Today I drank {num:5,10} tankards of ale.

I worked with {name:dwarf_male} in the mines, and we delved for {num:1,6} hours, as every Dwarf should!

Then I went home to my dear wife, {name:dwarf_female} daughter of {name:dwarf_male}. Over a hearty feast, we sang of the old tales of {choose:Durin/Balin/Fundin/Thrain} and {choose:Khazad-d√ªm/Belegost/Erebor}.
