Hey, you, maggot! The Boss told me that you're good at hunting!

He asked me, the scribe, if I could write a letter to you little maggot, telling you to bring the him the head of the stinking tark {name:gondor_male}. That fool laughed at the might of the Boss. Let's see if he can still laugh when his head's separated from his shoulders!

If you bring the Boss the tark's head, he will give you five hundred silver pieces as a reward for your stinking deed! And if not, the Boss will take your foul head instead, little maggot!

Now go ahead and do as you've been ordered!
