Trouble stirs across the Golden Ford. For the first time in many years, whispers have come that our neighbours in Rh√∫del are raising an army.

They must be heeding the Dark Lord's call. Gondor will be their prize... we are only merchants, but we really ought to do something. The Men of Gondor are our kin.

The Court assures us they will respect the trade agreement, and leave us be, but I do not trust the word of the Court. Most folk do not.

I fear that soon the flames of war will burn across our fields and vineyards, and then we will regret our idleness.
