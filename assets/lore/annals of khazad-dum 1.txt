Long ago, in an age now forgotten and lost to time, the kingdom of Khazad-dûm was the mightiest realm in all Middle-earth. Those were the golden days of our fallen city, and are described herein.

After the terrible catastrophes of the First Age, and the drowning of the Elder West, many of our kin from the Blue Mountains migrated to our great halls in Khazad-dûm. They brought with them much skill, craft, and lore, to enrich our city. Our people prospered greatly in those days, during which, it is said, Khazad-dûm reached the height of its glory and magnificence.

Some years passed, and the empty lands of Hollin west of the Mountains were settled by Deep-elves of the West, fleeing the ruin of their sunken realms. At first we were suspicious, but our peoples soon came to befriend one another; there was a friendship of Elves and Dwarves of a kind never seen before, nor in the many ages since. Together, our kingdoms grew and prospered. The Elven King Celebrimbor worked with Narvi, a great craftsman of our people, and they created many wonders together.

It was at this time that the great purpose of our toiling and tunnelling was achieved: at long last, the delvings of Khazad-dûm traversed the Mountains from East to West, connecting the wide regions of Wilderland and the Lone-lands.
