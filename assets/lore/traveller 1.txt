It has been many days since I left the comfort of my old home behind, in lands I passed long ago.

Whispers have I heard, of ruins of old in the northern wastes where the sky glows white and the red-trees grow. Many an Orc have I slain to keep my trail steady. Unwavering has been my pace - a pace I keep steady day after day, night after night.

Black clouds darken the sky.
