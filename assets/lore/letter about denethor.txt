Brother, I will not waste any words with introduction. Something is terribly wrong with Lord Denethor. His mind has become as a hollow shell; he seems focused on nothing but a great fear for the Eye in the Dark Tower. He no longer cares for his people. Many a day he locks himself in the Tower of Ecthelion, leaving the outside world to fend for itself.

I feel it too, my brother. Far across the horizon... Mordor grows ever stronger, the Enemy intent on wiping out the race of Men.

Yet Denethor grows ever more distant. He is fearful of the future, and rightly so; but he seems to have given up all hope, leaving our people to ourselves. If something is not done, I fear the worst: for the Lord Steward, and for Gondor, and for us.

So I plead to you, brother! I need advice! What can I do, here within the walls of the White City? Is there anything that can be done for Lord Denethor? Or are we doomed to destruction, not only at the hands of Mordor, but also by our own inaction?

Please respond soon!
Your sister,
