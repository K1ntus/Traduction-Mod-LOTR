To King Dáin II,

The days grow shorter and wearier.

Many months ago I sent Óin with some others to the Hollin Gate, but they have not returned. I do not know what has become of them.

I am not well, and I feel haunted by an unknown madness. Uncounted hours have I spent gazing into the Mirrormere. There is dark evil in the depths of Moria; I fear worse than Orcs may yet lurk in the shadows beneath.

We must tread carefully.

Balin son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.
