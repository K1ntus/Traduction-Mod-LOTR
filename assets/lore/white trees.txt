Telperion: the Elder-tree
that shone upon the western-sea,
And then was Galathilion
that gladly bloomed on Tirion.
Next Celeborn, and Nimloth fair,
that burned in subtle Sauron's lair,
and then the Trees of Gondor tall:
of Minas Ithil ere her fall,
of Minas Anor, walled and wide,
and Minas Tirith in her pride.
