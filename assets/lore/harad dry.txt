I and my company have been stuck out in this accursed desert for many weeks.

I await orders for a change in post, and yet I receive none. Our supply of waterskins runs ever lower, and my partner {name:nearHaradrim_male} collapsed from the heat a few days ago. He has recovered somewhat now, but I doubt he will be comfortable for long. I, too, have begun to suffer the heat.

Have they forgotten us? Are we doomed to die under the blazing sun, with nobody to remember who we were, or that we were ever here?

Is this what our doom has come to? Our lives to be slowly, painstakingly torn from our bodies; to be left as dried corpses, to rot in the sand?

Is this the end for me?

I cannot bear to think any further about it!
