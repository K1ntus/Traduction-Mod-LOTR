#A marching chant
#
The night is long and the day is bright
but we, the Orcs, don't need a light.
We scatter enemies in fright
on our way to Barad-dûr.

Work, work, work, lads!
We're off to Barad-dûr.

Our enemies they run in fear
when our tramping footsteps gather near
and so we march and march and march and march.
For we're off to Barad-dûr.

Work, work, work, lads!
We're off to Barad-dûr.

Over the mountains tall and cold
we venture everywhere, so bold!
And then we turn to that stronghold
the mighty Barad-dûr.

Work, work, work, lads!
We're off to Barad-dûr.
