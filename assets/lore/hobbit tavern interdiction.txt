Dear Mr. {name:hobbit_male} {name:hobbit_surname},

From this day forth you are barred from our respectable Establishment.

Your drunken Rampage of {choose:two/three/four} days prior has caused grievous Damages to our Furniture, which is to say nothing of the dreadful waste of Liquor when you in your inebriation knocked several of the barrels over (and very expensive stuff it was, too!)

Even more concerning was your ill-conceived decision to {choose:shatter an empty mug upon the head of a fellow Patron/relieve the contents of your stomach upon the Bartender/produce your Tinder-box and set alight multiple tables in the Tavern}.

If you wish to appeal, you may write to us to explain yourself, accounting for your wrongful Misdemeanours, and offering to recompense all Damages in full. But until such time, you are forbidden to set foot upon the Tavern Premises, in accordance with the King's Law and in the name of the Mayor of Michel Delving.

Your servants we remain,
the Most Respectable Staff & Patrons of {name:hobbitTavern_prefix} {name:hobbitTavern_suffix}
