The grass sways in the breeze. Several Warg packs have come by, but so far, none have come close enough to harm me. I wonder what it must be like, to be hunted across these peaceful plains. I hope I never find out.

On patrol by {choose:Eastmark/Aldburg/Edoras/Westmark/Grimslade/the Folde/Dunharrow} this morning. Grabbed a pint of {choose:mead/ale}, then headed out by the Entwash to survey. Nothing for miles around.

Just escaped a pack of Orcs wandering where they shouldn't have wandered. I've been conscripted to the western borders, near Dunland. Here's to hoping they don't come after us.
