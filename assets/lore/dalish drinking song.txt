Hey-ho to the keg!  Hey-ho to the beer!
Hey-ho to the leg of a lamb or deer!
Hey to the barley!  Ho to the ale!
Hurrah to the finest inn in Dale!

Why travel to lands both far and wide,
to stoke your prowess or fuel your pride,
when all you need is found right here -
in this wonderful, frothing, dark brown beer?

Hey-ho to the keg!  Hey-ho to the beer!
Hey-ho to the leg of a lamb or deer!
Hey to the barley!  Ho to the ale!
Hurrah to the finest inn in Dale!
{choose:
If you're lost among the pines,
wandering o'er the hills at night;
come and have a glass of wine,
sit with friends among the light.
/
When the weather's cold and damp,
and you'd rather feel more merry;
come and sit beneath a lamp
and drink a mug of perry!
}
Hey-ho to the keg!  Hey-ho to the beer!
Hey-ho to the leg of a lamb or deer!
Hey to the barley!  Ho to the ale!
Hurrah to the finest inn in Dale!
{choose:
Who needs to wander, to rove and roam
when he's got a cozy hearth and home?
'Tis foolish to explore out there
when you've got a homely mug and chair!
/
Here in halls of blue and red,
what better way the time to pass
than telling tales of cloven heads,
and sipping jars of plum kvass!
}
Hey-ho to the keg!  Hey-ho to the beer!
Hey-ho to the leg of a lamb or deer!
Hey to the barley!  Ho to the ale!
Hurrah to the finest inn in Dale!
{choose:
Think not of spiders, nor their brood,
but sing instead of this wonderful food!
Sing of the pastries, sing of the cake!
Our feasts are fine, make no mistake!
/
When the time is closing evening,
and all the Orcs are overcome,
still the friendly lights are gleaming
while we gather, drinking rum!
}
Hey-ho to the keg!  Hey-ho to the beer!
Hey-ho to the leg of a lamb or deer!
Hey to the barley!  Ho to the ale!
Hurrah to the finest inn in Dale!
