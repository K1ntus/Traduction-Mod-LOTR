Dear {name:gondor_male},

It pains me so, but I must inform you that your dear friend, {name:gondor_male}, has received the Gift of Men.

Ever since you left him in our care, he was coughing day and night. We sacrificed much of our sleep trying to treat his ills, but - alas! - his condition only grew worse.

Soon he began to spew his own blood, and before long there was nothing left we could do to forestall his passing.

They say that the hands of the King are the hands of a healer. If only we had the healing powers of a true King, then we might have saved him... but, forgive me, now is not the time for such talk.

My sincerest condolences. Our thoughts are with you, and with his family.
