Long ago, when the forests covered all the lands to the West, and our people were spread across the earth, we were visited by strange Sea-Gods.

In form they were like tall Men, though with life beyond the span of our years. They came from across the Sea in great silver vessels and built tall dwellings of stone upon our shores. The tales say they wore skin like iron, and their weapons could strike faster than the wind.

At first, they let our people be, and sometimes they even gifted us with powerful tools and knowledge. Our elders say they came from a far land beyond the Sea, that their ships bore them across the waves to all the far lands of the world, even upon the very clouds of the air.

But as time went by, these Sea-Gods changed their ways. They started cutting and burning our forests, and hunting us like animals. They stole many of our people away, never to be seen again. We knew not what we did to so anger the Sea-Gods.

And an age passed, and the Sea-Gods were no more. It is said that the Sea-Gods angered the Sky-Gods, and the Sky-Gods destroyed them for it. But we know not why; we only know the Sea-Gods are no more.
