This recipe doesn't require much thought early in the morning, and it tastes delicious! Your children will love them!

Ingredients:
* A bucket of milk
* Wheat
* One egg
* Maple syrup (optional)

Only Hobbit-friends can make these pancakes.

Recipe:
* Mix together the egg, wheat, and milk
* If using maple syrup, drizzle generously on top

And that's it. The tasty pancake is done - you don't even need to cook it!

Cook's Tip: A good mug of hot chocolate alongside the pancakes can't go wrong!

P.S. If you're too lazy to bake your own pancakes, there will surely be a tavern nearby that offers them.
