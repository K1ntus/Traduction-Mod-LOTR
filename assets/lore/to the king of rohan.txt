My lord,

I write to you in urgency. Our lands are under constant assault, being raided by the foul Hillmen from west of the Mountains. Their attacks have increased of late, and they have been aided by strange Orcs of the Mountains. Our garrison can hold them at bay no longer. We need reinforcements from Edoras, or else I fear the West-march will fall to our foes.

I hope the messenger reaches you in time. We cannot hold out for long.
