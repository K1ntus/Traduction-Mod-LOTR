My dear son,

It has been many a month since you last visited your mother and I. We have heard stories that you are now an advisor to the King in his hall! Your mother and I could not be more proud. Your name is spoken all around the village, and we all know you will serve the King well.

I hope to see you soon, son. Come to visit us when the King gives you leave.

With love,
Father
