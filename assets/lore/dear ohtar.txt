My most beloved Ohtar, it is with a grieving heart that I must tell you our little {name:gondor_female} died last week of the pox. She called for you in her sleep. 

I curse this awful war. I curse Sauron, I curse the East Wind, I curse the Lord Denethor for taking you from us. We need you at home, Ohtar... please, come home.
