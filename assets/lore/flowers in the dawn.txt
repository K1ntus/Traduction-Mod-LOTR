Flowers, flowers, in the dawn:
how you glisten on my lawn!
Roses, daisies, poppies too:
leaves and buds and stem and roots.

Flowers, flowers, in the day
form a living great bouquet.
Elanor, clover, marigold
grow forever, oh so bold.

Flowers, flowers, in the night:
fill the garden with your light!
Bluebell, iris, simbelmynÃ«:
slumber there until the noon.
