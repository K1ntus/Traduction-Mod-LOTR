Our people have prospered greatly from the aid of the Lord of Mordor. One of the many gifts he bestowed upon is the knowledge of crafting a mighty weapon.

Hell-flame, or as it is also known, Khamûl's Fire, is a potent and powerful weapon. Khamûl the Great took this gift from the Lord of Mordor and turned it into a mighty weapon for the use of our great armies.

It is said that hell-flame is made from the same powder we use for lightworks, encased in a gilded iron armour, but with the gift of the Lord of Mordor set deep within: whence comes its wicked power and potency. The flames of hell burn brightly, with great heat... and if some tales are to be believed, they can even melt through solid stone walls.

These constructions must be handled with great care. I have heard more than one tale of the untimely death of a golden regiment, and from the stories of how the men left behind little but charred ash, I rather suspect Khamûl's Fire was at work there.

But truly, with this weapon on our side, our armies will be unstoppable! The vile Gondorians, ever hiding behind their stone walls, are safe no longer!
