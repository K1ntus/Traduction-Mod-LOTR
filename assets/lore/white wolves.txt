Yes, here's an old story, lo!
That every young Halfling should know.
When white wolves came down,
and gave all folk a frown
at Eastfarthing's first sight of snow.
 
They came from the wastes of the North;
in the hills they roamed back and forth.
Iced Brandywine river
they crossed with a shiver,
to savage both Halfling and Dwarf.
 
Those wolves ninety winters ago
would've dealt us no end of woe
if not for fair Buckland,
the Shire-folk's luck-land,
who woke their alarm-horn to blow.
 
This horn must be blown only strictly:
don't mess - or be scolded bitterly!
With a shot and a shout
Buckland drove the wolves out,
and the Shire could celebrate victory!
