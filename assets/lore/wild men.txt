Some of what is now only remembered by the common folk, as myths in old tales and songs, may hold more truth than one might think. 

I have served the Steward as Chief Librarian for many years, and among my many studies, the old tales of Woses stood out to me. These Wild Men, from what we know, once dwelt in the Drúadan Woods to the north, and the great forests beside the cape of Andrast.

Not much is known about these stunted Men, but we do know that they lived in their lands long before the Rohirrim came south in aid of Cirion. The foothills and mountains, and much of the vale called Dunharrow by the Rohirrim, are all filled with strange statues. Púkel-men, we call them, and it seems they were built by the Wild Men long ago.

The Woses, by all accounts, are a very secretive folk. They rarely show themselves to travellers, preferring to keep hidden in their forest dwellings. They do not possess much in the way of smithcraft, but they are said to wield blowing-pipes and poisoned darts to defend themselves. Truly, they are masters of the woods. It is said that even the foul Orcs fear them.

Though there have been no accounts of Wild Men for many centuries, one should not forget all the hidden things that lie nigh to us. Many disregard the Wild Men as nothing more but old tales of forest savages, but I believe these old tales hold more than one might think.
