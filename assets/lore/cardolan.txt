Cardolan was a realm of yore,
a scion of old NÃºmenor.
From hapless years it rose, and yet
it left our joy in darker debt;
first quarrel, and her bitter birth,
then pestilence and barren earth,
and last of all, the Witch-king came -
he cursed her hills, he cursed her name.
The Barrow-downs we call them now:
fell remnants of a conquered vow.
