We will never forget the great wrongs done to us by the filthy Strawheaded horsemen!

Long ago, our people dwelt freely in the fields and meadows east of the Mountains. But then they came. A great host of Strawheads down from the North, riding their accursed horses. They pillaged our homes and burnt our villages, and they drove us out. The Strawheads robbed us of everything we had once known, even of our very lives, as our people fled into the hills. And in the hills we live to this day.

Though it was long ago, we remember the old homelands in our songs and tales, and we will never forget what the Strawheads did to us.

And now we have a new hope. The great Conjurer in the Iron Tower has promised to drive out the filthy Strawheads and give us our lands back! With his power on our side, we will be unstoppable. We shall finally have our vengeance!

Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers from the North!
