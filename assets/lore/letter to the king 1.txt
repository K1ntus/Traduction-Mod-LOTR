To King Dáin II,

It brings me honour beyond words to inform you that Khazad-dûm is reclaimed!

Upon first arriving at the Dimrill Dale we were assailed by a small host of Orcs, which we took great relish in defeating. We have buried those of our company that fell beneath the grass by the Mirrormere.

We have taken residence in the Twenty-first Hall. I was the first to walk beyond the gates of Azanulbizar and gaze upon Durin's Bridge. I was the first to return to the ancient home of our forefathers - of our kin.

What was once lost is ours again! All Durin's folk will sing of this day for years to come: the day we took back our home!

Balin son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.
