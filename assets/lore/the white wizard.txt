Within the Ring of Isengard stands the ancient stronghold of Orthanc, wherein resides the great Wizard Curunír, more often known among Men as Saruman the White.

Saruman is by far the mightiest of the five Wizards in strength and knowledge, and he holds great pride in this. He dwells not upon the practices of other Wizards; he befriends no wild creatures, and he seldom spares a thought for the little folk of Middle-earth. Instead, Saruman explores ancient lore, and studies skills he wishes to wield for himself. It is also rumoured that Saruman boasts a great mastery of speech and thought; that by the sound of his voice alone, he may command the will of any to whom he speaks.

It is whispered by some, of late, that Saruman grows ever hungrier for power: this they attribute to his ceaseless study of the works of the Enemy. While the truth of this is yet unknown, it is certain that Saruman the White, foremost among the Wizards, is of a more devious kind.

In my many journeys through Rohan and Gondor, I never once came across Saruman the White. On one occasion I arrived in the Wizard's Vale hoping to proceed past the walls of Isengard, but I found the gates shut, to my great disappointment. Thereupon I remained for a while, content to gaze upon Orthanc, in awe of the tower's beauty - and stricken by its commanding presence. But something about the sight came to unsettle me, and before long I turned away and set myself back upon the road.
