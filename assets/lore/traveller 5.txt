In recent days, I slew a lumbering Snow-Troll. But my left arm was broken in the skirmish.

The winds blow ever colder, and I fear I may freeze to death. But for now I have found refuge in ruins by the northern mountains.

The snow falls softly. 

In the darkness around me I hear noises far-off... the howls of Wargs! The screams of wild Men!

The night grows cold, and the noises are drawing closer.

I cannot lift my sword high with one arm broken. But nonetheless, I must face the darkness.
