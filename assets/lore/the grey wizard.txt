While travelling through the Shire and the lands nearby, one may come across the humble Wizard known as Gandalf the Grey.

Also known among the Grey-elves as Mithrandir, Gandalf the Grey is a joyous Wizard - quick to anger, but always the first to laugh. He wanders the lands without home or hearth, as an old man in tattered grey robes.

It is well-known that, unusually for a Wizard, Gandalf considers ordinary folk in the highest regard. Indeed, he can often be found in the company of Halflings of the Shire. But don't be deceived by his knockabout appearance and strange choices in company! Gandalf is arguably the wisest of the five Wizards, and second in skill to none other than Saruman the White.

In my many journeys as a wandering writer, I encountered Gandalf the Grey on two separate occasions. One night long ago, at the Prancing Pony Inn of Bree, I thought I spotted him seated a few tables away. This seemed unusual to me at the time, as I would not expect to find a Wizard in such a place, so I dismissed the sighting as mistaken. It was not until the following morning that I discovered it was indeed Gandalf whom I had seen the night before, and that he often frequented the Inn. Such was my surprise!

The second time I saw Gandalf the Grey was many years later, in the town of Frogmorton. He was ensconced in a pleasant pony-drawn carriage, and heading west. His eyebrows protruded like bushy caterpillars from under his pointy hat, and rings of smoke were puffing from his pipe. As he approached me on the road he turned his head, with a twinkle in his eye, and I will never forget the wise words he offered to me as he passed.
