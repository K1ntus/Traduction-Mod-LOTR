To King Dáin II,

I hope this letter finds you well. The colony of Khazad-dûm is thriving.

Shortly upon settling in the Twenty-first Hall we set out to work, for there was much to be done. Since then we have reclaimed many of the lost chambers and halls, expanding our dwellings, day by day uncovering more that was thought forever lost. Many forgotten treasures have been found, including Durin's Axe, which I have taken for myself. 

The fires burn in the deep; the mines and forges have returned to life. There are no words to describe the joy we have!

You will hear from me soon,

Balin son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.
