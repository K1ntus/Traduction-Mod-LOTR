Between the Carrock and the Old Forest Road, on the western edge of Mirkwood, one can find the old home of Rhosgobel. These are the dwellings of a simple Wizard, who goes by the name of Radagast the Brown.

Radagast is no ordinary Wizard, and it has been clearly noted that he is neither the brightest nor the strongest of the Istari. But he is known to possess an odd gift for taming the many beasts and birds of the forest, as well as a seemingly unending knowledge of the herbs and plants of the land. Many believe that Radagast uses the creatures of the forest as his eyes and ears, watching for any possible signs of evil or darkness at work. Although his activities of late are unknown, it is certain - at least to me - that Radagast is worthy of his title of Wizard.

In my travels I came upon the Brown Wizard only once. It was not too long ago that I found myself in the company of two Rohirrim who were on a journey north to the ruins of Framsburg. I travelled with them for a time, and on one twilit evening, quite by surprise, we came upon old Radagast by the eaves of Mirkwood.

He was nestled in an oaken tree, and I at first mistook him for a terrible beast, or a great brown bear. I watched him as he cared for a group of songbirds, who fluttered around his head with a simple elegance. For a time I stood, astonished at how easily the birds came and went about him, while he balanced effortlessly up in that tree. But before long he became aware of our presence, and with a sudden shout he leaped down from his branch and scurried away into the forest, out of my sight.

What a strange Wizard he is.
