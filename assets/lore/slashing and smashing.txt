Every day new maggots are sent to serve ol' Urbul, but nearly none of 'em scum know how to properly stick a blade on someone else's gut. Grr! I'll tell you, they may look like a pack of tough lads, but they're no better than a stinking Warg; all muscles and no brain, unlike ol' Urbul here, who has plenty of both!

This guide will show you what weapon suits a dirty maggot like you, if you ain't too thick-headed to read.

Daggers: These short mean knives are good for stabbing and nothing else. Put some poison on it and sure your enemy won't stand up again, nay he won't, he's done for.

Spears: They're good for throwing and poking your enemy from afar, swift an' all too. The Big Bosses send 'em to us in big numbers every day.

Polearms: Slow. Grr! Ay, too slow for Urbul. At least you can poke and pin your enemy before the fellow can stab or cut you.

Swords: Good for slashing open the stinking bowels of a stinking tark, if 'is belly ain't protected by shiny stinking metal.

Hammers: Ay, very slow, even for the bigger boys. But they're good for mashing heads, even if the fellow is wearing a metal cap.

Axes: Not as swift as a sword and neither as slow as a hammer. Urbul's strong lads wield them a whole lot while out in the field fighting the Boss's enemies.

Bows: I'm no stinking ground-sniffing Snaga to teach you how to bow-shoot. Ay, go bother someone else about it. What d'you say, maggot?
