My dear {name:hobbit_male},

I hear you have been showing some rather queer habits lately. Now, I know you are still (barely) just a tween; but our family are very well thought-of around these parts. And {choose:running off into the Old Forest/venturing outside the borders of the Shire/going off in search of 'Elves'/repeating Mad Baggins' tall tales of 'dragons' and 'wizards' to the children} is no way to uphold the good reputation of the family name!

Just the other day, I was sitting in {name:hobbitTavern_prefix} {name:hobbitTavern_suffix}, when I overheard {name:hobbit_male} and {name:hobbit_female} talking about how you are 'going on adventures' and how you have been 'setting a bad example for young Hobbits'! I had to reassure them that they must have misheard something, for such a respectable young fellow as yourself would have no interest in 'going on adventures'.

This is all I have to say for now, and I do hope you will come to your senses!
