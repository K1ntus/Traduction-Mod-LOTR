Hill-trolls tall as pine trees, waiting in the deep night,
must fear the sun's great might lest they turn to dark stone.
Many Dwarves are roaming the land in search of gold,
but those who are too bold will feed the Trolls their bone!
The few who do succeed, nor fall to lurking Orc,
will find the Troll's rich hoard of silver, gold, mithril:
now they can live like kings, until they sink to grave.
Soon Orcs crawl from the cave, from the dead to steal.
