Have you seen any burglarobbits round 'ere?
Blimey, I'm starvin'!
Give us a bit o' fresh meat, will you?
Mutton yesterday, mutton today. An' blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow!
Me guts are ramblin'!

What're you lookin' at?
Got any grub?
What're you up to?
I don't know 'bout you, but I'm starvin'!
'Ey up, what's all this then?
What do you want?
Got something other than that stinkin' mutton?
Oi! Get me some meat!

We better get off before that ol' Sun gets up again!
