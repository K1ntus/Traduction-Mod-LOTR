Let's go get some fresh meat!
I'm starvin'!
Can't wait to get me chops stuck into some nice juicy meat an' bone!
Blimey, when're we goin' to do some killin'?
Time to go give some little wrigglers a beatin'!
You what?
Blimey, I'm starvin'! Got anythin' to eat?
What're you lookin' at?
An' what've we got 'ere then?
What're you wantin' now?
I'm the most cleverest Troll in all o' the world!
Shut your cakehole an' get me some flesh!
I can't wait for a bit o' rough an' tumble!
My stomach is starvin'! Let's go hunt some Man-meat!
What are we waitin' for? My stomach can't hold forever!
After I kick 'em with my stick, they won't get up any more!
Time to hunt some fresh and juicy meat!
Oi! Let's get movin'! That ol' Sun won't be hidin' for ever!
