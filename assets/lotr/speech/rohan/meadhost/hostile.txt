No mead for you, scoundrel!
Get out of my hall!
I trade not with the foes of Rohan.
Get out, you brigand!
I shall serve nothing to you, #!
Leave now before I force you to!
You are no friend of Rohan, #.
What folly brought you here?
@ is not open to Rohan's enemies!
I give no service to criminal scum like yourself!
No! No mead for you. Get out!
Leave or face the wrath of the Men of Rohan!
You will have nothing from me, servant of evil!
What madness drove you here?
I will not serve the enemies of Rohan!
You are not welcome here, #!
