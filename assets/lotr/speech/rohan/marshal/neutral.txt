Only those greatly respected in our lands may command the riders of Rohan, #.
If you seek to hire the service of the Rohirrim, you must first prove we can trust you.
You seek to command the Rohirrim? You are no great lord of Rohan, #.
Not until your name is sung alongside the heroes of yore may you command our warriors, #.
We cannot fight beside one so young in deeds as you, #.
Are you seeking to command the forces of Rohan? I have heard no tales of your great deeds, #.
You will have to prove your allegiance to the Men of Rohan if you wish to command our mighty warriors.
My men shall not follow any stranger to war!
You will need to prove yourself first before you can command these valiant warriors.
Only true friends of Rohan can lead my men to battle.
Prove yourself to the Riddermark first and then I might let you command my men!
