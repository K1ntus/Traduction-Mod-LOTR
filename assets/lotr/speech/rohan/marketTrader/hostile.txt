Get away!
We don't tolerate scoundrels like you in the Mark!
Be on your way, #!
I won't be selling anything to you.
Be on your way or I'll beat you with this loaf!
We don't appreciate your kind here!
I don't deal with villains, #!
You should be locked up, not wandering around markets!
Off with you, or I'll summon the guards!
The riders will be after you, #!
Run off! Else I'll beat you with this!
You won't be getting any of my goods!
Get out of here, you scum!
I don't want any trouble, you hear?
I'm an honest merchant, #, but you're not an honest fellow.
I only trade with the good-hearted men of the Riddermark.
Well, I shan't be buying anything from you.
Aren't folk like you supposed to be kept out of these parts?
I shan't be selling anything to you, #! Good day!
Guards! Here! Guards!
Scum of Isengard, you are!
Begone, criminal!
The riders will be after you, #!
Sorry, #, but I don't do trade with no-gooders like you.
Riders! Riders! This fellow stole my wares!
Stop! Thief!
