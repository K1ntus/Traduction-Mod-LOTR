You are not welcome in the Mark, #!
You should have fled these lands long ago!
You will pay for your crimes, #!
We Rohirrim shall not suffer your presence in these lands, #!
You're a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
I suggest you leave this place, #.
Away with you!
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
You shall get no welcome here.
The heroes of Rohan will strike you down, #.
You ruffian! Back to where you came from!
You serve the White Hand!
You're worse than the wild Men!
Guards! Guards!
The treachery of Isengard is unwelcome here.
Don't hurt my horses!
Off with you, you villain!
I don't do dealings with ne'er-do-wells like you!
Away with you, #. We want no evil here.
What are you, #, bandit, Goblin-man, or some devilry of Isengard?
You are a devil in the White Wizard's service! Begone!
Ruffians like you aren't welcome here.
The King's Riders will strike you down, #.
You shall pay for your crimes.
Stay away from me.
I'll be having nothing to do with you.
You and your kind aren't welcome in Rohan.
Away with you, you villain!
People like you aren't welcome in these lands.
