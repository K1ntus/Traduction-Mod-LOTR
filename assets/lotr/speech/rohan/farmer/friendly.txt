Good day, #!
Hello there, #! Do you want to buy any crops?
You looking for some fine crops, #?
Don't forget to not step on my crops!
I hope you've not been stealing any crops!
Got any farming equipment? I'll offer you a good price.
I have some fresh crops that you'll like!
I offer you the best crops in all of the Riddermark!
I'm always in need of new farming tools! Get me some and we can trade!
My farmhands are the hardest-working in the whole of the country! Bring me some silver coins and you can hire some.
I take great pride in my produce.
If you're looking for some finely-forged weapons, you've come to completely the wrong place!
Did you know, #, that all the farmers in Rohan wear the same hats?
Turnips, carrots, lettuces, wheat, I've got it all! Well, maybe not all, but you get the idea, #.
These crops aren't free!
Can you smell it, #? Ah, the country air!
Don't forget to feed the horses!
Horses, #. Oh, those horses love a good treat fresh out of the ground.
