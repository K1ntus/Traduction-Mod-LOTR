Good day, #.
The crops are growing well.
Hello there, #.
This is fertile soil.
The green fields of the Mark are good for growing things, #.
Ah, if only I had an ox to speed this up...
There is much farming to be done.
I'm working hard, as you can tell.
It's nice of you to talk to me. We farmhands don't get much conversation.
There's not a whole lot to be said about farming.
Remember to keep hydrated!
And how are you today, my friend #?
Is it time for a break yet?
We Rohirrim are great riders, but we are fine farmers too.
Our crops will be ready soon!
I hope the horses will get to eat plenty of this.
Our horses love freshly grown crops.
Another busy day on the farm, I suppose.
They sing no songs of farmhands.
The men in the mead halls tell no tales of great farmhands.
It looks like it's about to rain, you know.
Beware the trees of the Entwood!
