We Rohirrim shall not suffer your presence in these lands, #!
I shall not suffer your presence here!
You are not welcome in the Mark, #!
You should have fled these lands long ago!
Tremble where you stand, #!
It was foolish indeed of you to venture into our lands!
Your doom shall come swiftly, #!
No pity for the foes of Rohan!
I will not allow you to stain the land of Rohan with your devilry!
You shall meet your doom swiftly, servant of Isengard!
Begone from our lands, or face the sharp points of our spears!
Leave or face your doom!
You will pay for your crimes, #!
The treachery of Isengard is unwelcome here.
