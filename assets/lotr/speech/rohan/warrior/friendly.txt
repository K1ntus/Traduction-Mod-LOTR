Welcome, #. What brings you to the land of Rohan?
What business do you have in the Riddermark, #?
Welcome to Rohan, #.
Don't forget to feed the horses!
The world of Men has fallen from its former glory.
I hope to see the world of Men restored, as it was in the days of old.
These lands are troubled, #. Orcs often break through our borders.
Ever we must rid our lands of the Orc filth that plagues us, #.
Welcome to Rohan. From which land do you hail?
Hail, #! We are the riders of Rohan.
These are the lands of our fathers, and our fathers' fathers. It is our duty to guard them.
The horses of Rohan are the finest in all Middle-earth.
Beware the Uruk-hai. They come here often in raiding parties, leaving only destruction in their wake.
New life grows ever where the forefathers of Rohan sleep.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the Orc that one fears.
Welcome to the land of Rohan, #!
I hope you're not forgetting to feed those horses.
In these grim times our lands are often besieged by the servants of evil.
The Hand and Eye of the Dark Lord ever afflict us in these fell times.
Greetings, #! What tidings do you bring to the Riddermark?
I wonder how those Dunlendings can be as foolish as they are unsightly... oh, were you talking to me, #?
Have you heard the songs of Helm Hammerhand? They say he slew Dunlendings even to his last day on earth.
Have you heard the songs of Helm Hammerhand? They say he was found dead in the snow, with the blood of Dunlendings still frozen on his hands.
The Dunlending wildmen name us Strawheads. Well, #, I would rather have straw for hair than live every day among dirt and pig-filth.
There are many great horses in these lands, #, and all are fit for battle.
A strong horse needs good hay, #. So don't forget to feed them!
Are you in league with the Sorceress of the Golden Wood? Webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.
Seldom do we have travellers in this land. What is your purpose here?
