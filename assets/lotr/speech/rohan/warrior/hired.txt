For Rohan! For our people!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together!
Let us fight together for the Riddermark, #!
For the Riddermark!
Our enemies shall be brought to ruin!
We shall earn much glory on the field of battle together, #.
The foes of Rohan shall tremble where they stand!
We ride out together. For glory. For Rohan!
The foes of Rohan shall tremble beneath our feet!
No Orc or wild Man shall pillage the land of Rohan under our watch!
Let us hunt some Orc!
For the King of Rohan! For Edoras!
Let us ride together and clear the land of Rohan of all ill-doers!
