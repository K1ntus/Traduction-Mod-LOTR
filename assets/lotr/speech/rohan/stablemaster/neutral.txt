We Rohirrim guard our horses carefully.
You may know how to ride a horse, #, but how well does the horse know you?
You'll have to go elsewhere, I'm afraid.
We treasure our horses, #. I wouldn't just give them out to a stranger like you.
Good day to you, #! Are you a friend of Rohan, or just passing by?
I can't say I've seen you before.
You're not from around these parts, are you?
