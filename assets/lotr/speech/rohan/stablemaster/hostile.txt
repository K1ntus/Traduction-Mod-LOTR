Begone with you, foul beast!
You shall never lay hands on a horse of Rohan!
These horses would kick you to the ground if you so much as set foot in their paddock!
No horse would ever serve you, #!
Out with you! Villain!
This land is no place for foul beasts like you.
May your steed cast you from its back!
Keep off my horses, you scoundrel!
No horse of Rohan would ever deign to serve a villain like you!
You are no friend to our horses!
You are an enemy to me, and to my horses!
Away with you, #!
I would not trade with a scoundrel like you.
Off with you, you ne'er-do-well!
These horses wouldn't trust you, and nor do I!
No horse of Rohan would ever see fit to bear you!
You disgrace the very stables in which you stand!
You are no friend of Rohan.
These horses are no friend to villains like you.
You should run far from here.
I will not welcome you into my stables.
Leave my stables!
