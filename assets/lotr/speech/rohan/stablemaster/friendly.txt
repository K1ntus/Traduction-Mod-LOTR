Hello there, #. 
If you seek a fine steed, you've come to the right place.
My horses are waiting in the paddock.
These horses love treats. Do you have any fruits or vegetables?
Welcome to the stable, #!
We Rohirrim have the best horses. Believe me.
I can see you are a friend to horses.
Do you need any horsing supplies?
There's nothing these horses love more than a good apple from time to time!
I never forget to feed my horses.
A horse needs plenty of hay.
Good day, #! How was your ride?
We have great respect for horses.
These horses all need feeding!
The horse is a Rohir's best friend.
I love these horses, #, each and every one.
A gentle horse-master leads to a happy horse.
Be sure not to spook the horses!
These horses are noble beasts, #.
The horses of Rohan are wise and noble. See that you treat them with care.
Don't forget to feed the horses!
