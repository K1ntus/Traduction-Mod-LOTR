Orcs like silver coins as much as the next race, you know...
Bring me coins if you want equipment.
So you have proven yourself, #. Now we can trade.
A nice little stinking sum of silver coins might be nice.
If you want to trade, bring some coins, and keep it quiet.
An Orc can never have enough silver coins, maggot!
I might be interested in buying some materials.
Certain materials can fetch a good price among traders like myself.
I love crunching on a nice Elf bone!
You want some equipment? Get me some coins first, maggot!
Get me some coins and I'll get you some tools!
If you want some of my fine equipment, then bring some coins!
I sell the finest equipment and the sharpest blades!
I don't usually trade with filthy Men, but you're good enough.
