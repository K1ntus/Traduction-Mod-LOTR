You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of Men can command Orcs, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any Orcs to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
The Orcs of Dol Guldur would never follow a weakling like you, #!
Are you scared of spiders, maggot?
You wish to command the Orcs of Dol Guldur? You think you can lead an army? Prove it, maggot!
It will take more than a bunch of shiny coins to lead an army of Orcs!
No mere Man may command the legions of Dol Guldur!
You want to command my lads? Ha! Don't make me laugh, maggot!
Ha! You wish to hire some Orcs? Foolish worm! Show your ugly face again when you kill something!
