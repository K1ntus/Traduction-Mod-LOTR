What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Orcs here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The forces of Dol Guldur are ready for hire, maggot!
Dol Guldur has many fine stinking Orcs and spiders for you to command!
I hear the Nazg√ªl speak highly of you. My Orcs shall follow you!
You may be a Man, maggot, but you seem worthy enough for my lads!
Give me just a few dozen coins and you'll have an Orc to command!
The legions of Dol Guldur shall fight for you!
All free peoples shall tremble beneath the feet of our armies! Shall you lead us, #?
