You may not enter L贸rien, #!
Do not touch the trees of the Golden Wood!
You are not welcome here!
No evil hand shall slay the trees of Lothl贸rien!
The axes of the Enemy are forbidden here!
The Mallorn trees shall not be felled!
You may not set foot in Lothl贸rien, #!
No tree shall fall by evil hand in this wood!
Those who bring destruction to L贸rien will be met with it themselves!
Evil is not allowed in these lands!
How dare you fell the beautiful trees of the Golden Wood? You are truly a servant of evil.
What evil is this? Be gone from our lands, spawn of Morgoth.
Foul spawn of Morgoth! You shall pay for defiling the trees of the Golden Wood.
You shall answer for your crimes, #!
