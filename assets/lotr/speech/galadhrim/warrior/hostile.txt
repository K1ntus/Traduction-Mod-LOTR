By Elbereth, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in Lórien!
You are not welcome in Lórien, #!
You may not set foot in Lothlórien!
Flee these lands, #!
For Lothlórien!
Perish, you Morgul-demon!
No longer shall you darken these lands, #!
I swear by the Valar, I shall put an end to your evil!
To Udûn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, foul servant of the Enemy! 
Leave this land, or face the edge of our blades!
I will not allow evil to corrupt the land of Lórien. You shall soon meet your doom, #.
By the Valar! How dare you enter this land, #?
Flee, scum of Mordor, or face a rain of arrows!
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
