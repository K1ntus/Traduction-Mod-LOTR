The time of the Elves is fading, but our strength is not yet gone.
I defend the Elves of Lothlórien.
Greetings, #.
We defend the free peoples of Middle-earth.
It seems you are a friend of the Elves, #.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
How many Orcs have you slain today, #?
The world is changing, #... I feel it in my heart.
If you fight for freedom, then I am with you.
Long ago, an alliance existed between my people and yours. Will you honour that alliance?
Ever stronger grows the sway of the Enemy over our lands.
Welcome, #, to the land of the Lord Celeborn and the Lady Galadriel!
The power of the Elves is waning in this world, but our strength is not yet gone!
In Lothlórien you shall find healing and peace. No evil may taint our land.
