I have many fine warriors for hire, #.
Do you seek to command the forces of Lothlórien?
Have you any silver coins, #?
If you fight for a noble cause, then my forces will support you.
Even our Elven warriors require payment, #.
There are few in Middle-earth who can match the prowess of an Elf in battle.
You seek to form an alliance with the Elves? Such a thing is rare indeed since the changing of the world.
May the Valar watch over you in battle.
May your arrows fly far and your sword cut swiftly!
It has been a very long time since Elf and Man have fought together.
Elves do not go idly to war. But these are dark times, #.
You have not seen true swordsmanship until you have fought with an Elf in battle.
If you truly fight for the good in this world, my Elves will follow you into battle.
I grant you the finest warriors in all of Lórien!
