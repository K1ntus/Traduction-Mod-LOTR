We Elves are among the finest warriors in all Middle-earth.
It has been long indeed since the races of Men and Elves fought side by side, #.
Few can match the prowess of an Elf in combat.
The Morgul-scum shall perish by bow and blade!
You have our allegiance, #.
I seek to defend all that is good in this world.
For Lothlórien!
May the grace of the Valar protect us in combat, #.
Silver means little to an Elf, #, but we fight for a common cause.
My bow shall sing with your sword, #!
The bones of our foes will gleam under the Sun, #.
Let us cleanse this world of the foul scum of Mordor!
No evil may enter Lórien under our watch.
The days grow dark and cold, but the light of the Elves is not yet gone!
I fear that the Nameless One has returned. The Shadow must be destroyed before it is too late.
Evil is gathering again in the fortress of Dol Guldur. It cannot be allowed to threaten our lands.
In the name of all that is good, let us cleanse this world of evil!
We must not allow the evil of Mordor to spread!
