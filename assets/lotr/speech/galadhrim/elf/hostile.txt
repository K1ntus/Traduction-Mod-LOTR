No evil may set foot in the Golden Wood!
You may not enter Lórien.
#, you may not set foot in Lothlórien!
You breathe so loudly I could have shot you in the dark.
You are unwelcome in our lands.
Your presence is unwelcome here.
You are no Elf-friend, #!
The Enemy has no hold over Lórien!
We suffer no evil in Lothlórien!
You may not bring evil here, #!
Your darkness shall not poison our sacred woods!
To Udûn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, servant of evil!
Go back to the shadow whence you came!
We shall not allow evil to enter our realm. Leave now or face our wrath!
You bring great evil here, #. You can go no further.
Leave, #, or face the might of our arrows!
