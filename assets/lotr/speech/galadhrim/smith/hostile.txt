Be gone, foul scum of Morgoth!
You will get nothing from me, spawn of evil.
How dare you enter this fair wood? Your doom shall be swift, #.
I will give you nothing, scum!
You have no power here, servant of evil!
I would rather die than give you any of these weapons!
You will have nothing from me but your doom, #!
Leave or face the wrath of my kin!
I will not allow you to taint my gleaming armour with your foul hands!
Go back to the darkness from which you spawned, scum!
Leave this wood or face our wrath, #.
I shall not allow evil to taint this wood! Be gone!
Be gone or face the wrath of our kin!
Be gone from our lands, foul spawn of the Shadow!
You will meet your doom before you get any of my weapons!
