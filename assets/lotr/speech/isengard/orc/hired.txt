Where's the nearest Man-flesh? I'm starving here!
What are your orders, my lord?
You may be my commander, #, but you're still a filthy maggot!
I smell Man-flesh!
Lead us to war, #!
The air is ripe with the stink of fear!
I've had nothing to eat but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
The free peoples of the earth shall fall before our might!
Death! Death to all who oppose us!
