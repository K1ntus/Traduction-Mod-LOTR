Come crawling back when you've proved your worth, weakling.
The stench of evil on you is not yet strong enough, #.
If you wish to trade, you must prove your worth among our forces!
I've seen more threatening Halflings than you!
You want to trade? Come back when you're further down the path of darkness, scum.
Go and slay a few stinking Elves, and then perhaps we can trade.
If you want any Uruk equipment, you'll have to work more evil first.
There's no way I'm trading with a maggot like you!
Do you think I just hand out equipment to anyone, maggot?
I don't trade with scum like you!
Kill some of those filthy horse-men and then we can talk!
Prove your worth, filth!
You won't be getting any equipment from me, maggot!
I don't trust filthy Men like you! Beat it, scum.
