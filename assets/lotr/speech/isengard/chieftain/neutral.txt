You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of Men can command Uruk-hai, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any Uruk-hai to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
You can barely even ride a Warg, so why should I let you hire any stinking Goblin-Men?
Filth like you wanting to hire Uruk-hai? What's the next trick?
Go kill some of those filthy horse-men and then I might consider letting you command my mighty Uruk-hai.
Prove your worth, filth, and then come back!
You want some of my fine Uruk-hai! Ha! What kind of joke is this?
You won't be getting any soldiers from me, maggot. Go cut some heads and then come back!
You're not getting any soldiers from me, maggot! Start killing some Men or beat it!
