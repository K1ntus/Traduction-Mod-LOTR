What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Uruk-hai here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
My Uruk-hai are the strongest Orcs in all Middle-earth!
Your foes will tremble before our Warg riders, #!
Bring me some silver coins, maggot!
I can build you an army worthy of Mordor!
Get me some coins and I'll get you some troops!
I got some fine troops that're good for killing!
If you get me some coins, I will sell you some of my boys!
My boys will serve you well in the slaying of those filthy horse-men!
No enemy may stand against the might of my fighting Uruk-hai!
