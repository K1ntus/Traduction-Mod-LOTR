Come back another day, #. You are not worthy yet.
You are not fit to lead my soldiers, #.
Prove your worth in battle, and kill more rats of the plains, and then you might earn our loyalty.
Show me that you are more than just a peasant, #.
Can you even fight? Go and kill some more savages!
You would bring nothing but weakness to my warriors.
You, leading my men? A joke! You are not even worthy of my respect, #.
Only great warriors deserve to lead other warriors. You are no great warrior.
What makes you think you are worthy of leading my men, #?
Go and kill all the Snake-Men in the North, and then maybe you can buy my warriors.
Pathetic. Not even a mark on your face. You cannot lead our warriors.
I see no reason to give my warriors to a weakling like you.
