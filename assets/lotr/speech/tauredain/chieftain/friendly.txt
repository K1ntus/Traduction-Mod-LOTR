The Lion-Men must pay for their crimes. Burn their homes, loot their treasures, and slay their people!
It is time for war, #. War against the thieves who stole our Mûmakil.
A new empire is rising. Will you lead us to victory?
They burn our trees and steal our Mûmakil. But now, #, now is the time for revenge.
My men have a reputation to uphold. Leave the grass-tribes cowering in fear.
Drive them from their homes with blade and poison and fire! Show those savages our strength!
My warriors are yours to command.
War will come to all. Lead my men to victory!
The power of the jungle will break the strength of mortal men!
The great Mûmak will lead your stampede against our enemies, #!
Show no mercy to those desert snakes!
