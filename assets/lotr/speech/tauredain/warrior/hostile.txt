You thieving mongrel! Run with fear!
Run while you still can, slave of evil!
Your death will be painful and slow, #!
Prepare to die, friend of the Enemy!
Your people are not welcome here!
I will avenge our stolen gods!
We shall throw your bones to the crocodiles!
We will paint the ground with your blood, #!
Your wounds will sting like the venom of the scorpion!
You are foolish to go against the might of the old empire!
You are a demon out of the North. You have no place here!
Another savage from the wild plains. Kill it!
You are less than a rabid beast, #!
How dare you stand against our mighty empire?
You were a fool for coming here, and now, #, you will die!
