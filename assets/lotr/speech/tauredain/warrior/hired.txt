We fight for you, #! Lead us to victory!
Death to the Lion-Men!
Our empire will rise again, #! We will follow you to victory!
The Snake-Men enslaved our MÃ»makil. Destroy every one of their people!
Show those grassland savages no mercy!
Go, #, show our enemies the meaning of fear!
Our foes will flee in fear with you leading us, #.
They won't last long against us, #!
They stole our sacred beasts, and now they will pay! To war! To war!
We will fight by your side, #.
The Snake-Men and Lion-Men will pay for their crimes!
They stand no chance with you leading us, #.
Our empire will rise again! Lead the Forest-Men to victory, #!
We will follow you into any battle, #.
