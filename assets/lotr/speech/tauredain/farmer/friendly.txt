Our fields are rich and bountiful, #. We will never let our people starve.
The Lion-Men pillage our fields and burn our land. But our people will not starve at the hands of those savages!
We grow the greatest crops in all the world. Unlike the foul grass-tribes. They only know how to steal!
The jungle is kind to us, #.
These forests give us life, and in return, we help them grow.
We grow many crops here, #. The jungle has blessed us.
Show kindness to the trees and the fields, #, for without their fruit, you would not be alive.
We are kind to the earth, so that when our time comes we may sleep peacefully beneath it.
War? It was not war that made us great, #. It was the fields and the trees.
Too many have forgotten that we owe all our lives to the jungle. The shamans know, but they are few.
If you are wise, #, you will eat mangoes. They are good for you.
Do you wish to buy anything from the jungle?
The jungle may give its fruits freely, #, but I ask for a little silver.
There is much good in the earth.
I have many choice crops on offer.
Are you hungry, #?
Our people work the fields with care.
Do you seek help on your farm? I have some farmhands looking for work.
