You don't quite have my trust yet, #. Come back another day!
I don't want your mangoes, #.
Prove your friendship with our people, and then you may buy from me.
You look like trouble, #.
I doubt you have enough money for my goods.
You don't look like one of us.
I bet you like banana bread, #. Fool!
You are not a friend of my people, #. Begone.
I doubt you are any better than those thieving Lion-Men, #.
Mind yourself, #. It is unwise to make enemies in this jungle.
