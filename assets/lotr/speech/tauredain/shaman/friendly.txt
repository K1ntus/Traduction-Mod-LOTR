Are you sick, #? I can heal many things!
Who eats banana bread anyway?
Banana bread is such a disgrace to good breads.
Do you have any delicious mangoes for me, #?
I'll buy lots of fruits, if you have them, #.
My darts are the sharpest in all the jungle!
I might have just what you are looking for, #.
What can I get for you #, warrior of the jungle?
I hope you have enough silver, #.
My goods aren't pricey, but they're not cheap either, #.
You could use some strength, #. I may have just the thing!
