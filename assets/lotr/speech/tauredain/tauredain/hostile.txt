Leave this jungle, #!
You don't belong in our homelands!
Die, grassland savage!
You won't last long here, #!
Weaklings like you don't last long in these forests!
I'll feed you to the crocodiles!
Flee, servant of evil!
Barbarian of the plains! Begone, #!
Your death will be quick, #!
Run while you can, # - this will only hurt a lot!
You are not welcome here, friend of the Lion-Men!
The jungle beasts haven't slain you yet? Then I shall!
The evil Eye cannot save you now, #!
You will choke on your own blood, #!
The Great Lion has no power here, #!
