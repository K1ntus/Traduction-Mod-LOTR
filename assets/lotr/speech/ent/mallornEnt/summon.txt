Who dares defile the golden trees of Laurelindórenan? Be you Man, Dwarf, or Morgoth-spawn, your doom has now come!
Little Orcs! Mischief! The trees cry out for help! And I have heard... hroom hroom, I have heard, and I awake!
Trees of Tauremornalómë, my brothers and sisters, let us awaken and defend these lands!
You do a great wickedness against the trees of Laurenandë! I shall crush you like a rock, little one!
