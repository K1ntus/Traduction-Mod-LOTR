Away with you!
You are an enemy of our people!
Begone, #! I will make no deal with you!
I would not arm you, rat, if you paid me in solid gold!
I will not see my craft in the hands of a villain from the West!
You have no honour, #!
You are no friend of ours!
The high craft of my forge is not suited for scoundrels like you!
