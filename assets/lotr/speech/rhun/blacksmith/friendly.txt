Welcome to my smithy, #!
I make the best arms in all of the East!
You'll be needing this armour when you go to fight for the Eye.
The Great Eye demands that you buy arms from me!
Welcome, #. What can I offer you?
Do you like what you see on display?
The armour I forge here will turn all blades and stop all arrows!
Gilded armour is expensive, # - but I can make that too.
The smith-craft of our people is unmatched by any in the West!
You would do well to carry one of my blades into battle!
My friend, I can armour you and arm you better than any else in this land.
Few have mastered the craft of weapons to such a height as I.
Our lords would be pleased if you arm yourself well!
Welcome, #! Is it weapons you will be needing, or armour?
Ah, Rh√ªnic steel. Nothing holds an edge like this fine material. Hard as dragon scales, light as a feather!
Greetings, #. You are most welcome in my smithy.
All the young ones are going off to war, #, and I have been left without my apprentice!
Any blade of mine will carve a Gondorian in two with a single stroke.
Ever since the war began, proper steel has been hard to come by.
I have heard tales of your deeds, #, and I would be honoured to have your patronage.
You can search all the villages of Gondor and Rohan, but you will find none to challenge my skill at the forge!
Helmets, chestplates, swords - they're yours my friend, as long as you have enough silver!
Welcome to my forge, #. To prepare for the war, it is burning all day and all night.
There are many men I must armour - but I think I can sell you something, #.
