I cannot sell you the craft of my smithy, #.
Our lords would be displeased if they saw I had armed one such as yourself.
I am sorry, #. You shall have to seek arms elsewhere.
These weapons I make are a high and noble craft. I cannot sell them to any wanderer on the street!
I cannot trust that you would bring honour to my forge.
How would my blades fare in your hands, #? I cannot trust that you would use them to earn honour.
I sell my craft only to honourable Men.
I have never heard of you, warrior from the West. I cannot trust you not to turn my weapons against my own kin.
Words are words, but actions are something else, so earn my people's respect and I will sell to you.
We are not so foolish as to trust a stranger like you, #.
Do you stand with us, #, or do you rally to the banner of the White City?
I have not heard tell of you, #. I should like to hear your name in the songs of our people before I trade with you.
You will have to show me that you can be trusted before I offer my wares to you.
When I hear my kin calling your name, #, then I will trade with you as you wish.
