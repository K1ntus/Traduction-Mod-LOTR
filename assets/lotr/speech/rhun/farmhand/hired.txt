Good day, #.
This is good soil.
Our crops are growing stronger.
We must feed the armies of Mordor!
These crops will go to feed our armies.
I am working hard, my lord.
The Men of the West are poor farmers. As they are with all else.
Have you come to check on the farm?
We are making good progress with the farm, #.
There is much to be grown here.
Our homelands are green and ripe for farming.
All these lands around the Sea are good to farm.
What do you ask, #?
Welcome, my lord.
