We shall fight the Men in the East! Wait... in the South? West? Gondor!
Just one more drop!
That soured milk is making me feel unwell!
Welcome back, my old friend! I have not seen you in so long.
I never understood why our roofs are built so.
Why am I here?
Hello, #! I have missed you, yes, dearly!
The great Eye is watching!
I will give my life to defend these lands! Where did I leave my sword?
Just one more cup of soured milk for me!
Where did I put my pomegranates?
Who are you, #?
Ah, #! My son! My old friend!
This wine is... who?
Where are my friends, #? Have you seen them?
What time is it, #. Early enough to start drinking.
Let us have more wine!
Last night I dreamed of signing for the war in the West. Wait, who gave me this dagger?
I am so sad! What will I do without the wine of Dorwinion soon?
If my lips don't stink of wine, my wife won't know they're mine!
I'm so drunk, #, someone could steal my liver!
I wish this was a fine chalice of white Dorwinion wine!
I've heard those Gondorians are building a wall! *hic* They call it Rammas... something...
I admit it, #. I once fell in love with an Elf in Dorwinion! It was only once! Or twice?
You there! #, right? How about you buy us all a round of soured milk?
Help me, #! Some strange fellow in a market was asking to buy my liver!
#! You look like someone who can have a drink with a true Easterling! Cheers!
I know you! You are that Dwarf who ran away with my wife! No? Oh, I'm sorry.
