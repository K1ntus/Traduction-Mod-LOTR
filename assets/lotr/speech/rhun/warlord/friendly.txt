My men are here, #, to serve you - and the great Eye.
Make no mistake # - my men are the best warriors west of the Red Mountains.
I have led my men many times into the West. Now, #, you may command them.
I suppose I could spare you a few of my men, my friend. For the right price, of course.
Our lords are pleased with your service. You may hire my men, if you wish.
Truly, #, you are a ruthless warrior. Just so, to make Gondor bleed!
I have heard much of your deeds, and your strength in battle. You may command my warriors.
A fine warrior like yourself would be well suited to lead a raid against Gondor.
Lord Sauron bids us prepare for war.
Lord Sauron is grateful for your deeds, #. I will let you command my men.
Are you ready? The great Eye will have us march West, #, very soon indeed.
