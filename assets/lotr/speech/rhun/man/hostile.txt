Flee, you DÃºnadan filth!
Begone, #!
You are a Westron and an enemy of our people!
Run back to Gondor, #!
Your Stewards can't help you now!
Get out of these lands, #.
We do not welcome you here.
Today, you shall fall by my hand!
The golden army will crush you all!
I was hoping I might have cause to draw my blade today!
I fight for my land, and my people! You serve only weak old Men and pointy-eared princelings!
Your Westlands will not survive the might of the East!
I can smell your fear already, you rat.
These lands are ours, and you are no longer welcome here!
