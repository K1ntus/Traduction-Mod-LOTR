I await your orders, #.
I stand with you.
My blade is yours, #.
I would follow you into the White City itself!
The lands of the West shall burn!
For the Golden Empire! For the Great Eye!
Please, #, don't make us march with those dirty Orcs.
I have waited long for the day of our vengeance!
Gondor is weak, #. They will not survive our assault!
I am ready to fight with you!
Our people are stronger, faster, and better armed than those Western brutes.
The Men of Gondor are weak.
Let us march West, #!
Long have I wished to lay waste to the lands of Gondor.
I will do as you wish.
