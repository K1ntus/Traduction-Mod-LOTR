Remember, #, the Men of Gondor are evil. We must destroy them.
Every time a Gondorian falls, our ancestors celebrate!
Elves do not deserve their long lives, #. Blind to the world, and yet so arrogant...
Our armies will soon meet with our war-kin from the East and the South. Vengeance is near, #!
You should never trust the Dwarves, #! One ran away with my wife to the Red Mountains!
I always liked those wine-merchants. It is a sorry state that we might have to burn down their breweries if they continue to resist the great Eye.
Our people have suffered enough at the hands of Gondor. We shall destroy them!
Once, many lives ago, the Men of Gondor tried to put all of our people to the sword. But they have grown weak, and we grew strong!
Be careful when journeying into the hills, #. They say wild beasts lurk there.
Will you fight with us, #?
I see you share a hatred for the villains in Gondor.
Take up your sword and spear, #, and follow us to victory!
Make no mistake, #. Our people may suffer in this war with Gondor - but we will be victorious.
Soon comes an end to the wickedness of Gondor.
The White City will burn!
We march West soon. Be sure you are ready, #.
The Orcs are on the march, #. We may serve a common cause, but I cannot say I bear them any love.
