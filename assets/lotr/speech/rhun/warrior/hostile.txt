Look! Another wretch, to be slaughtered like a sheep!
The great Eye is with us, #. You will never prevail!
Your time here is over, #. I will make sure of that!
Your time on this earth will end now!
Foolish of you, #, to take up a fight with us!
Surrender, #! You can not survive our strength.
You have chosen the wrong side in this war!
You should not have come here!
My ancestors are smiling on me, Gondorian. Can you say the same?
No more will we suffer under the hands of Westerling filth!
The Eye is rising, and your lands will burn!
You cannot hope to challenge the power of the East!
Flee, Westerling filth!
You are a villain out of Gondor!
