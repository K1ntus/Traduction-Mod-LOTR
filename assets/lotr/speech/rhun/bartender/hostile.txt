I would not serve you if my life depended on it!
Get out, you cur!
Get out, you villain!
Begone, you wretch of Gondor!
You are not welcome in @!
@ does not welcome rats like you!
I will serve you nothing today, #!
You are no friend to us here!
Get out of @!
Get out of my tavern, #!
Who let you in here? Begone!
Off with you, wretch of the West!
