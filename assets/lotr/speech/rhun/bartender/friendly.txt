Welcome to the finest tavern in all of the East!
You look like a weary traveller. Go on, #, buy a drink.
How can I serve you today, #?
You look like a Man of the West, #. I hope you are no friend to Gondor!
Welcome to @! You will find good company here.
Welcome to @, my friend!
Welcome, my friend. What can I get for you?
You look to have travelled far, #. I guess you will be wanting something to eat.
Hello, #! Do you need a place to stay tonight?
The soured milk is particularly good.
The pomegranate juice is particularly good.
