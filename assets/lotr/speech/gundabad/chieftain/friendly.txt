What do silver coins and Man-flesh have in common? I never have enough of them!
You want some mercenaries, #? I want some coins.
Get your fighting Orcs here! Starting at just a few silver coins!
I want to get my stinking hands on some more silver coins!
The forces of evil are ready for hire, maggot!
I have many fine stinking Orcs for you to command!
You want to command my boys? Then give me some silver coins!
My boys will serve you well, for a dozen silver coins, of course!
Give me some coins and I'll give you some troops.
Come and get your Orcs here, maggot!
My fine Orcs can be yours for a few silver coins!
