Come here, fishies!
Come to Sm√©agol, fishies!
The rocks and pool is nice and cool!
It splishes, and it splashes, and then we strangles it!
Stop wriggling, fishies!
Splish, splash, stamp!
It's raw! It's wriggling! It's juicy!
We sees it! Yes, yes! The fishies will be ours!
Sweet and juicy, slippery and cold! Where are you hiding, my fishies?
Curse these slippery fishies!
Fishies swim fast, but not fast enough!
Come to us, my sweet fishies! We doesn't hurt you!
