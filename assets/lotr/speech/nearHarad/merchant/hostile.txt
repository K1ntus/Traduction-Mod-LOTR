I will not trade with an enemy of Harad!
If the Men of Gondor are your allies, you are my enemy, #!
I shall not trade my wares or silver with you. Sell your wretched goods elsewhere!
The silver of Harad will not ever find its way into your hands, #!
There is nothing for the likes of you to buy!
Númenórean scum! Get out of my sight, #!
If Harad is your enemy, then so am I!
No treasures of Harad for you, Gondorian filth!
I will not trade with the servants of Gondor!
Begone, scum of Gondor!
I'd rather die then let you touch the treasures of Harad!
I do not trade with filthy Gondorian scum!
You will get nothing from me, #!
