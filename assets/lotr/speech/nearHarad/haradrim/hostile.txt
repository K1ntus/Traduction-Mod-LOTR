The desert heat must have addled your brain, #. We do not suffer your kind here!
Curse you, filth-friend of Gondor!
Return to the foul lands whence you came!
No treachery of the Dúnedain may enter our lands!
May the fires of the desert claim you, #!
You chose most unwisely in journeying here.
Flee, enemy of Haradwaith!
Your life and your lands shall soon be ours!
This is no place for a villain of the North.
Fool! What madness drove you into this desert?
These lands are not for you, my enemy!
Scum! I will feed your bones to the great scorpions!
You had better flee our lands or face our wrath, #!
May the fury of the Sun consume you!
Begone, filthy servant of Gondor!
My people don't tolerate Dúnedain scum!
