My warriors are yours to command, great lord #.
Have you wealth of silver, #?
Friend of Harad, do you seek to hire warriors?
If you seek a fighting force, we Haradrim are second to none.
Have you any silver coins, #?
I have heard of your great deeds, #. Gladly will I let you hire my warriors.
Do you seek to command the mighty warriors of Harad?
For a few silver coins, I will give you command of some of my men!
Word of your deeds has spread quickly in our lands. It would be an honour for my men to serve you!
No warriors in all the world can rival the mighty Men of Harad!
My men are strong and mighty warriors. Do you seek to hire some?
