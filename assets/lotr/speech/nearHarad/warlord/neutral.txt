I cannot allow a stranger to hire my warriors, #.
Who are you? Are you a friend of Harad, or an ally of Gondor?
Until you have proven your allegiance with us, we will not fight for you, #.
Do you fight with us, or against us?
Who is your master, #?
You must perform great deeds in the name of the Haradrim if you wish to command our warriors.
You will need to do more good for our people if you wish to command my mighty warriors, #.
The Haradrim do not simply follow any stranger into battle. You will have to prove your worth!
Whom do you serve, #? The Great Lord of Mordor, or the foul DÃºnedain?
You will have to prove your allegiance to my people, #.
