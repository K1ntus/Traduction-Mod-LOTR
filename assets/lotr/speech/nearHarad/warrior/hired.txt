The scum of Gondor are no match for my blade.
The serpent strangles the withered tree.
Gondor shall fall!
I am ever in your service, lord #.
I would follow you to the ends of the earth, #!
To battle! To the fall of Gondor!
War is coming.
The lands of the North will soon be ours!
For Harad!
There will be no dawn for the DÃºnedain.
I am ready, #. Shall we go to war?
I have never lost a battle!
