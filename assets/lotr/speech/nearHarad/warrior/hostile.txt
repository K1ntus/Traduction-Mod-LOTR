The desert heat must have addled your brain, #. We do not suffer your kind here!
Curse you, filth-friend of Gondor!
Return to the foul lands whence you came!
No treachery of the DÃºnedain may enter our lands!
May the fires of the desert claim you, #!
You chose most unwisely in journeying here.
Flee, enemy of Haradwaith!
Your life and your lands shall soon be ours!
This is no place for a villain of the North.
Fool! What madness drove you into this desert?
These lands are not for you, my enemy!
Flee, scum of Gondor.
I will not allow you to terrorise our lands!
Your death shall be swift, scum!
What drove you into this madness? Your end shall be quick.
I will not allow the scum of Gondor to invade our lands! Begone!
