Welcome, traveller. What brings you to these lands?
Greetings, # of the North.
Welcome to the dominion of Harad.
You must have travelled far indeed, #.
What do you seek? Counsel, trade, or war?
It is not often that folk of the North-west find themselves wandering in our lands.
Are you a friend of the Haradrim, or do you come seeking strife?
Let us hope you are no friend of Gondor, #.
It is rare indeed that we Men of Harad greet Men of the North.
How came you here, #, and why?
No slave to the corruption of Gondor is welcome in our lands. Let us hope you do not serve Gondor, #!
I have seen few Men of the North indeed during my days beneath the sun.
Shall you aid us to make war against Gondor?
I would welcome you, #, but my heart grows uneasy around a traveller from the North.
I hope you are no friend of the DÃºnedain, #. Well, if you were, you would be mere sun-scorched bones by now...
Welcome, #, to the lands you call Near Harad.
It is no small wonder that one from the North has crossed the Great Desert and lived.
You have journeyed far indeed.
Do you serve the Lord of Mordor, or the Gondorian scum?
Welcome to our warm lands, traveller from the North.
What tidings do you bring to us from the North?
You must be truly blessed to escape the wrath of the Great Desert! Welcome!
Welcome to our lands, traveller from afar.
I have not seen a Man from the North in many long years.
The White City will turn to dust.
The serpent strangles the withered tree, #.
