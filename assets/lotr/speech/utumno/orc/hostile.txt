I smell man-flesh!
Flesh! Flesh! Flesh!
Come here! I'll make a good dinner out of you.
How did you get down here? Doesn't matter! You're supper!
We must serve the Great Dark One! We will obey!
Where are you trying to run, filth? There is no escape from the shadows!
I will strangle you like a worm!
Yes! Fresh flesh! I've not tasted it in thousands of years!
Boys, we'll be dining on fresh flesh today!
If He commands it, I will obey.
What is this? How did you get down here, worm?
Run, scum! Run before you get squished like the pitiful little worm you are.
His word is law. All must obey.
No light can escape the terror of His darkness!
Our Lord shall return, one day... and we shall rise once more!
Your pointy stick is no match for the wicked blades of Melkor!
You have made a terrible mistake entering here! Soon you shall be inside my stomach!
Yes! Your flesh smells good, light-filth! You will make a good supper.
You smell good! I will enjoy feasting on your flesh!
Ha! Ha! Fool, do you really think your puny little blade can pierce my plates?
He will return one day, and we shall rise and rule the world once more...
I'll throw you to my dogs, scum. They will enjoy ripping your flesh apart!
