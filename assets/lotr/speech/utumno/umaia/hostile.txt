No living being may enter these ancient halls. And no living being may leave them!
What is this? A worm out of the depths? How came you here?
No blade ever forged by Man or Elf or Dwarf can save you from the darkness of our Lord!
You cannot escape. You shall be consumed by the darkness.
You fool! You have made a grave mistake entering our halls. 
Fool, there is no escape. You cannot run, and you cannot hide.
No light can overcome the darkness of Utumno!
Whatever form of life you are, scum, you shall not remain so for long!
Ha! The Valar must be fools to think that pitiful scum like you can stand against the Great Darkness.
What filthy spawn of the surface world are you? Bow down to the will of Melkor or you shall feel our wrath!
Fleshling, you shall be consumed!
What are you? How dare you enter here? You shall soon meet your demise.
Come here, filth! My Orcs shall be pleased. They have not had fresh meat in ten thousand years!
I am Ainur, born of the songs that sung the world into being! Your pitiful weapon cannot harm me!
Scum, you shall soon meet your demise. No living being can escape the darkness of Melkor the Corruptor.
I am your doom. I am your death!
What are you? Some filthy spawn of Orc? I will feed you to my chattels.
Soon you shall be corrupted as all light that ever entered here. And then, you shall serve me!
Death cannot save you, scum. Even your wretched spirit shall serve me!
Whence came you, filth? How did you enter here? It matters not. Soon you shall meet your doom.
No creature has left these pits in ten thousand years. And you shall not be the first!
You think your weak mortal flesh can challenge me?
Your tiny blade cannot pierce me, fool!
Pitiful fool. You shall meet your end soon.
What madness drove you here, outsider? Doesn't matter. You will meet your end here.
Your pitiful flesh will be consumed by the darkness. Not even your blackened bones will remain.
Fool! You have made a terrible mistake entering these dungeons.
