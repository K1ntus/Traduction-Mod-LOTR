Good day, #.
The crops are growing well.
Hello there, #.
This is fertile soil.
These lands are good for growing things, #.
Ah, if only I had an ox to speed this up...
There is much farming to be done.
Thieves! Foes! Sound the alarm - oh, it's just you, #.
I'm working hard, as you can tell.
If I were a slave in NÃºrn, these crops would be growing even faster.
It's nice of you to talk to me. We farmhands don't get much conversation.
There's not a whole lot to be said about farming.
Remember to keep hydrated!
And how are you today, my friend #?
Is it time for a break yet?
Dorwinion belongs to Gondor. And don't you forget it!
