Your death shall come swift as the arrow that pierces, #!
I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in the land of Gondor!
Flee our lands, you scoundrel!
You are an enemy of the Men of Gondor, #!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back to the shadows whence you came, #!
You thought you could match our skill? You are sorely mistaken!
When did # forsake reason for madness?
Your doom approaches, #!
Do not underestimate the Men of Gondor.
Begone from our lands, servant of the Enemy!
You are no friend of Gondor, #!
How dare you spoil this fair realm with your foul feet?
You will tread no further in this fair land.
I will not allow you to stain this land with the evil that you bring here!
