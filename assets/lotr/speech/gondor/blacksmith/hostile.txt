I shan't be forging anything for you!
You are an enemy of Gondor!
You are an enemy of Gondor, #!
What are the likes of you doing in Gondor?
Get out of my sight, you cur!
I refuse to trade with scoundrels like you, #.
I do not forge for the servants of evil! Begone!
You will not get anything from me, #!
Scum of Mordor! How dare you enter Gondor?
The valiant Men of Gondor shall make quick work out of you!
I will give you nothing, #!
