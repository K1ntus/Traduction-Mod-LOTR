Only strong friends of the Blackroot Vale may command our armies, #.
If you wish to command the forces of the Blackroot Vale, you must prove that we can trust you.
Are you friend or foe, #?
They say you are a friend of the Men of Mornan, but I cannot be sure until you have done more good.
One does not simply command Blackroot bowmen without earning some reputation first.
You are not yet thought of highly enough to lead our bowmen into battle, #.
Show us that you can be trusted, #, and we will allow you to lead our soldiers.
You wish to command my bowmen? You'll have to prove yourself to the people of the Blackroot first, #.
Only a true friend of the Blackroot Vale can lead our valiant soldiers into battle.
You'll have to prove yourself as an ally of the Mornan-folk before you can command my bows, #.
You must do more good deeds for the people of these vales if you wish to command our armies.
Prove your allegiance to the Blackroot Vale and I will let you command my warriors.
