You may go no further. You will not enter Gondor!
Sons of Gondor! Hold your ground!
You may not enter Gondor, #!
For Gondor!
You are an enemy of the throne of Gondor, #!
Enemies have entered Gondor!
By the White Tree, I will see you slain!
I swear to Gondor that your death shall be swift!
Your death shall be swift, #!
This is a fell hour for Gondor indeed!
No pity for the foes of Gondor!
You will not see the end of this day, servant of the Shadow!
Begone from our lands, foul scum of Mordor!
I will not allow you to harm the free folk of Gondor, #!
In the name of the kings of old, I shall destroy you!
No enemies of Gondor may pass freely into our land!
