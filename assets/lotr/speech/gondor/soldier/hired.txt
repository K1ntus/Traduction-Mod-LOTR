I fight for Gondor, #.
May our deeds restore Gondor to its former glory!
The foes of Gondor shall fall before us!
For Gondor!
Our enemies are right to fear the might of Gondor, #!
You are a true friend of Gondor, #.
Today, we fight! For Gondor!
We shall follow you through death and ruin!
We are proud to fight amongst a great warrior such as you!
For Gondor! For all the good in this world!
The scum of Mordor shall face our wrath!
Ruin to all the enemies of Gondor!
