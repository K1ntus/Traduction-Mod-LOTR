Don't just pass by my shop, # - come and see!
Every bit of coin helps, #. I have children at home I have to feed.
#, would you consider taking a look at my stocks?
Ah... #? You remind me of that Northerner who passed by here last week. What was his name again? Thorongil?
You don't seem to be from these parts, #. Can I help you?
I could definitely use some coin to pay off that job in Pinnath Gelin, #... whoops! Forget I said that!
You seem friendly enough, #. Care to take a look?
This is the best shop south of the Argonath!
#! I knew you'd come and buy here!

I'd love to have some of that coin of yours.
Say there, #. Do you have any coin to hand?
Come and browse these wares, #. You won't regret it!
I didn't come to this market just to stand here and stare at the clouds!
Ah, #! You'll buy something - won't you?
I have a family to feed, #.
You seem like a friendly fellow, #. Just the sort I like to trade with.
Do you have any goods to sell?
Do you have any coin to trade?
Any goods to sell, #?
I wonder if you're carrying anything valuable.
