I shan't be selling anything to you, #.
Sorry, #. I don't trade with ruffians.
You're not welcome in my market, #!
If it was up to me, I'd call the guards on you...
You're a ne'er-do-well if I ever saw one, #.
I don't do trade with villains.
There's no need for folk of your sort here, #.
I'm an honest merchant, #, but you're not an honest fellow.
I like to think I'm an honest merchant. Sorry, #, I shan't be trading with you.
What did you think you'll be getting from me? Flowers and a song? You're a nasty piece of work, #.
No thank-you, #!
I'll have to turn down your business, #. I only trade with honest folk.
I only buy and sell to good Men of Gondor.
I don't make custom with folk like you.
Well, I shan't be buying anything from you.
Aren't folk like you supposed to be kept out of these parts?
I'd trade with you if the guards weren't watching, #.
