Ring ding diddle diddle I de oh ring di diddly I oh!
Roll roll roll roll, roll-roll-rolling down the hole!
Hey ho! To the bottle I go!
I drink, therefore I am.
Tippity tippity tap! Splish splash splosh!
My ale! Mine!
Do not turn me about so, #. My stomach is not constant.
Stop walking on the wall, #! Ho! Ho!
Here and there, ale is everywhere!
I couldn't live without my ale!
The ale is mine! 
Up and down and left and right, I will drink until the end of night!
Teh to ti ti tum!
More ale in my pail!
These Orcs are crazy!
Mushroom! Mushroom! Mushroom!
I used to be an adventurer, just like you. Then I discovered ale!
*Hic*
Help! Everything is square! How long have I been here? Am I going mad? Please help me, #!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of your finest ale!
They see me! They see you! They see everything!
A fine pail of ale is finer than a fresh quail of nail!
A song! A song!
Sing, #! Sing!
How dare you oppress me so?
My singing talent eclipses even that of the Elves!
Give me a reason to fight and I shall drink ale!
Well, well, haven't you come a long way! I haven't seen you in years, #!
Get off me, you drunkard!
You shouldn't have *hic* drunk so much, #, you fool.
Goodness me, what a fine day for it!
Ah, my old friend! Welcome home!
Ring a ding a ding dong, sing me a song!
You'll want to back off, else we'll be having a scuffle!
My, my, my, aren't you a strange fellow?
Your breath stinks of ale. Begone!
Why do you sway around so?
Aha, yes, you're a clever little fellow, aren't you?
Stand still there!
Get out of my tavern!
I will sit the throne of Gondor! I will be your King!
Stay well away from me, Southron!
There's always room for more drink!
Yes, and a fine place for it!
Oh, I quite agree, #.
I'll have you know I have quite the tale, to have you know, my #.
And what a day for it! What a day indeed!
Don't you like to drink, #?
My old friend! Come, drink with me, #.
Now's not the time for it.
I already told you, I have quite the tale for you to know, a tale. Now go away.
That's not what you say, is it?
I'm strong, I am. Strong and I can talk too.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Those cursed Southrons.
I've seen some things, #. By Elendil, I've seen some things.
You want me to tell you that old tale again?
Speak up, #! I can barely hear you.
You're a dim old fellow, aren't you?
That's very clever, #. Very clever indeed, yes, very clever.
I'd tell you, but then I'd only have to tell you again, you old fool.
Here I am!
Goodness, isn't it dark in here?
Slow down! All of you, slow down.
I've had it up to here with your tomfoolery.
Is it time to go home yet, #?
