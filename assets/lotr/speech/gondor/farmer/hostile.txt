Get out! No crops for you!
Sound the alarm! We have a villain on our hands!
You're not getting any of my harvest!
If you were a turnip, #, you'd be a rotten one!
You are no friend of Gondor!
I'll beat you with this here hoe if you come any closer!
I may only be a farmer, #, but I can still hold my own!
Who let you in here anyway?
You've made a big mistake!
If you were a harvest, #, you'd be a failed one!
Get out of my farm, you good-for-nothing sack of muck!
You're frightening my animals!
