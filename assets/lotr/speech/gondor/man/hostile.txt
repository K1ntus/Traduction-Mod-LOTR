You're no friend of mine, #.
You're a villain!
Get out of my sight, #.
Run along, #, else I'll call the guards on you.
You won't be doing any crimes here!
You're a nasty piece of work, #.
You are no friend of Gondor, #.
You shall get no welcome here.
You'd best be careful around here. It's not safe for criminals like you.
Leave Gondor while you still can, #.
We don't look kindly on criminals here!
I suggest you leave this place, #.
Away with you!
Our people have no love for villains like you!
The heroes of Gondor will strike you down, #.
You'd be best to leave, #. Or would you rather be forced out?
You belong in the stocks, #!
Don't look at me like that.
What do you want from me, you scoundrel?
We have no love for people of your sort.
You're a ne'er-do-well, #, that's for sure.
Off with you, #! We don't welcome ne'er-do-wells in Gondor.
