I would not serve you if my livelihood depended on it!
Get out, #!
Get out! We do not serve the likes of you in here!
We will not suffer your like in Gondor, #!
You are unworthy of the stalest mead!
You may fill your belly elsewhere, #, but not in my tavern!
You're not welcome here at @!
Leave now, you traitorous villain!
Turn your back on me, you cur!
@ does not cater to the likes of you!
Turn and leave, #, lest I cast you out myself.
You wouldn't be fit for a spoiled cut of meat.
You are a stain on the honour of my tavern, #.
I shan't be serving you anything!
We don't serve ne'er-do-wells like you. Not here!
Get out of my tavern, you good-for-nothing rascal!
You're a nasty piece of work, you are, #. No ale for you.
We don't serve ruffians like you in here.
No scoundrels in here, #. Try another tavern!
