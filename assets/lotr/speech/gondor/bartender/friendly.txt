Welcome to @.
Welcome to @, #!
Are you weary from travelling? We have lodgings upstairs.
Hungry? Thirsty? What'll it be, #?
Welcome to the finest tavern in all of Gondor!
You look like a weary traveller. Go on, #, buy a drink.
Welcome to @! You won't find company quite as good anywhere else, that's for sure.
Have we met before, #?
Go on. Have a drink!
My patrons say this is the best tavern in all of Gondor. And you know what, #? They're quite right!
Don't just stand there, #, get yourself a drink!
My patrons are some of the most good-natured fellows you'll ever meet. Isn't that right, friends? Now how about some more to drink?
This place isn't called @ for nothing, #.
We have rooms upstairs, if you're looking for a place to stay.
Are you new to these parts, #? You should get to know my patrons. They can be interesting fellows.
Don't just stand around, #. Go and talk to people!
I've seen some things, #.
If I were in your position, I'd buy myself a drink.
Those Southrons are nasty folk. You shouldn't talk too loudly around them, #.
You'll be wanting something to drink, I gather.
I could drink even a Swan Knight under the table if I had to.
When the atmosphere's as merry as this, what does it matter if the drink's a little stale?
Come on, #. Drink up! Or are you no better than those prissy golden-haired horselords?
The only brew for the brave and true... comes from @!
Those Northmen can keep their fancy wines and bread, for all I care. There's nothing quite so refreshing as a warm Gondorian ale.
You again, #?
No livestock! No Orcs! And absolutely no Southrons!
I once had a lad come in here trying to tell me my tavern wasn't real, and we were no more than ghosts in the dream of some old scholar. The poor fellow was quite drunk, #. Quite drunk indeed.
Don't forget to close the door on your way out, #.
