I protect the Banner of the Swan.
We must defend these shores, my lord #.
The scum of Umbar draw ever closer to our shores...
Not a single Orc, Southron, or Corsair shall set foot upon the shores of Gondor under my watch!
Our allegiance lies with Gondor.
We must protect these shores.
The Evil that was banished has now returned. We must defend our lands.
I serve the Prince.
In my people, the blood of NÃºmenor still flows.
