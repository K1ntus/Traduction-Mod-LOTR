You may go no further. You will not enter Dol Amroth!
You may not enter Gondor, #!
For Dol Amroth! For the Swan!
You are an enemy of the Silver Swan, #!
Enemies have entered Gondor!
By the Prince, I will see you slain!
Your death shall be swift, #!
This is a fell hour for Dol Amroth indeed!
No pity for the foes of Dol Amroth!
You will not see the end of this day, servant of the Shadow!
Begone from our lands, foul scum of Mordor!
I will not allow you to harm the free folk of Dol Amroth, #!
In the name of the princes of old, I shall destroy you!
No enemies of Gondor may pass freely into our land!
Begone, foul scum of Mordor!
Crawl back to your miserable black ships, worshipper of Morgoth!
Your kind is not welcome in our lands. Begone, you traitor to the Eldar!
I will drive you back into the Sea, spawn of Umbar!
