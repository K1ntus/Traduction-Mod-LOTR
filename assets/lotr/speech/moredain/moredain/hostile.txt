The Great Lion will devour your soul, #!
Flee, coward!
May you never taste mango again!
The flaming Eye will destroy you!
Did the Forest-Men send you?
#, your name will be lost to the wind!
Another soul for my blade to feed on!
An enemy of the tribes has no friends in these lands!
Go back to the forest, you pitiful twig!
Raaaaargh!
For the flaming Eye!
Flee, unworthy creature!
#, savour your demise!
I want your blood, #!
You have the strength of the flamingo!
You defy the Great Lion?
For the Great Lion!
Yaaargh!
Forest-Man! Die, #!
Run or face your death, soulless one!
I have no pity for you, coward!
Our tales tell of Men such as you, #! Know that they all met their end painfully!
A test for my strength! I shall savour my victory over you!
I have seen braver bananas than you, #!
