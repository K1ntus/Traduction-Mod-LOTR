If I die fighting, my family shall be proud!
May the Great Lion bless our weapons!
#, do we stop for meat?
I can finally prove myself in battle!
The wind holds tidings of war.
I hope one day to return to my tribe.
My feet are sore, #.
Are we to fight for the flaming Eye?
It would take a lake to quench my thirst!
You fight like a lord, #.
I have hunted zebra and crocodile. One day I shall hunt Forest-Man!
It is merely a flesh wound.
I smell battle!
My children shall be big when I return!
When a man dies, his soul meets the Great Lion. Some day I too will meet him.
I have trained for many a day in the heat of the plains.
Some fruit and Snake-Man water would be a blessing!
One day the lands will return to the greatest of the lions.
The flaming Eye fills me with fear, #.
A banana is always welcome on my plate!
#, where are we headed today?
#! Please don't put me on guard duty again!
I know no fear!
Filthy Forest-Men fear my name!
Time for drinking!
