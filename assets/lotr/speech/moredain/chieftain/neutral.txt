My honour is proven. Do you wish to prove yours, #?
You wish to control my men? Prove your valour!
You are not yet worthy of mango. May you become so.
My men serve no commoner, #!
My men slaughter Forest-Men every day!
Who are you, #? I have never heard your name in these lands.
#? What a common name!
The best animal to hunt is Forest-Man!
Flamingos have more bravery than you, #. Prove your worth!
Your blade has not yet tasted Forest-Man, #.
I am a proven warrior. What are you?
The flaming Eye will soon notice my name!
Mangoes are the fruit of true warlords!
Even the Great Lion trembles before me!
You must work harder for your rewards, #.
Soon my turn will come to see the Great Lion.
I have others more worthy of my time.
I wish to speak to honourable Men. Move out of my way, #!
Us Men of the Plains deserve more Men like me!
I do certainly desire to consume a mango.
I have the finest waters of the Snake-Men!
The only Men you will lead are the banana-collectors, #.
Seek your honour in the North with the flaming Eye!
Return with the lives of enemies upon your sword!
