Can I persuade you to buy some goods, #?
My goods are the best that all the tribes of the plains can offer!
Even the Great Lion comes to buy my goods!
I sell to the Snake-Men. Surely I can do a deal with you, #?
One day, I will monopolise the mango market!
Can I offer you some quality goods?
I source my goods from places far over the horizon.
Do you want meat or mango? Or perhaps something else...
#! Come over here and buy my goods!
I have passed under the nose of the Great Lion and back to bring you these trinkets!
My travelling has taken me to many places.
I need money to pay my... debts.
My prices are fair. No haggling, #!
The quality of my wares is legendary in the tribal gatherings!
Are there any other goods that you need?
I see your pocket needs relieving of those heavy coins, #!
May I persuade you to purchase some fine goods?
A gift for a loved one perhaps, #?
May you return to your tribe having savoured a mango!
