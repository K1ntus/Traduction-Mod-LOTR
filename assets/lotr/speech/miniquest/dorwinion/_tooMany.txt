Hey ho, #! I can't ask you to help. You've got unfinished business.
Well, #, it wouldn't be right of me to burden you with more to do.
You're already busy, aren't you, #?
Well, #! I appreciate the offer, but aren't you busy already?
Haven't you already promised to help those others, #?
You're already busy, #.
I can't ask more of you, #. You're already busy.
