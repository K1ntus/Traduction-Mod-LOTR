You can't help me while you have so much to do!
Are you trying to work yourself to death?
You've already made promises, little maggot!
You're even less trustworthy than the rest of your kind. Go and finish your tasks, #!
Can't we trust you to finish a job, #?
Finish what the others asked of you, #. You're going the right way to end up over someone's hearth!
You shouldn't come looking for more trouble, little maggot.
Can we trust you or not, #? Go and finish those tasks.
Why would I ask you for help? You can't even do your own jobs!
A pact with the Troll-folk is not made lightly, #. Now you'd be wise to run along and see to those tasks of yours...
Run along and finish your jobs... or I'll have you for dinner! Ha! Ha!
One job at a time, #! A dead maggot is no use to us!
