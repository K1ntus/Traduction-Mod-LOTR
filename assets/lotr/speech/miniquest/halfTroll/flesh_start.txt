My boys will need some flesh while they go to the war in the North. Bring me $ and I'll give you something for it, but be quick, or I might be tempted to take that flesh from something else!
I need some more flesh for my stew! These filthy maggots just won't do. Get me $ and I won't have to put you up for dinner!
