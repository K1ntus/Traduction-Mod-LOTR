My friend, are you not laden with tasks already? I cannot accept your offer of help.
You are already busy, #. It would be wrong of me to burden you more.
I am grateful for your offer, #, but you should remember your promises to others first.
Go and make good on your promises before helping me.
We Men of the Sunlands remember our promises to others, #, and you should too.
I can't accept your help while you have so many unfinished tasks.
Did you not offer to help others already, #?
I thank you for your offer, #, but I can see you are busy indeed.
You are too busy to take on what I would ask of you.
A promise of help is not made lightly, #! Go and remember those such promises you have made.
You are busy, #. I can see this. I won't ask more of you.
I would not further burden a camel who is already struggling. And neither should I take your offer of help.
