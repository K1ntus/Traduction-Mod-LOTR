Blowguns are far superior to any bow, especially in the hands of a skilful Forest-Man. Unfortunately, most of us lack enough darts to last the whole battle. We need many more of them if we are to stand a chance against the brutal lion-tribes. Do you have any unwanted darts, #? If you could bring me $, I would be very thankful...
