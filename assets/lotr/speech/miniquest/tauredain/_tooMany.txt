Stay true to those you have promised, #!
Remember those offers of help you have already given.
Well, #, I can ask no more of you. You have much to do, and many to help.
Don't forget the promises you have made to others, #!
Are you not already busy, #?
Others have asked for your help, #. Do you not remember?
You have promised to help others, #, with the forests as your witness. Be sure you do not forget them.
You are good to offer your help, #, but you must hold to your other promises first.
There is no honour in taking on more tasks while you forget the rest.
You have many promises already, #. You should remember those.
Make good on your promises to the others, #.
And what about those others to whom you pledged help? They need you more than I do, #.
