For many lives of Men, my family have guarded an heirloom of the old kingdom, a work of the high Arnorian craft that none today can replicate. But these are dark days, and safety is worth more than memory. I have heard tell of your deeds. If you are truly a friend to the DÃºnedain, then slay $, and I will gladly give up the craft of Arnor for a hero who deserves it.
