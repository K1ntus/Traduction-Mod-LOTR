Those long-eared demons may be far away, but they are ever a threat to our kin. And who knows when they will next choose to come wandering here? They are rats, and we must wipe them out. Journey west and kill $, #. Do it for Rhudaur!
The Elven-demons, distant as they are, need to be butchered as well! Far too long have they grown in strength. Slay $, and prove your might as a warrior of Rhudaur!
