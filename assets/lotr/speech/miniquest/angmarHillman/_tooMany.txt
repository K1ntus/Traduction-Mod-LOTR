What are you, #, that you would ignore your promises to my kin?
You have already promised your service to others, #.
We hillmen value loyalty and honour, #, and you should too. Go, finish your other tasks first.
You should make good on your promises first.
Go and make good on your promises, #. We put stock in loyalty, unlike those DÃºnedain filth!
I can't ask more of you while you let your other promises go unfulfilled.
First, #, you must see your other tasks through to the end.
Have you no honour? Do your promises to my kin mean nothing?
Others of our kin are still waiting for you, #. Get back to work!
Remember your promises before you pledge to do more.
You should remember those pledges you've already sworn, #.
