The mighty lion is the strongest beast on the plains, and we respect and fear him. But we Moredain are stronger still. It is a tradition among my people that you must hunt and kill a lion to prove your strength. I have heard you are strong indeed, #, so I challenge you to kill not one, but $! Should you return alive, a great reward will be waiting!
