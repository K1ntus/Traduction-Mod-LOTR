You should help my brothers and sisters first.
I doubt you could handle what I'd ask from you right now.
You can only carry so many sticks before you lose grip on them all, #.
You have already promised your help to others, #. Have you no honour?
If you cannot hold to your duties now, #, why should I ask more of you?
You have sworn your service to my kin, #. Make good on those promises first.
You want to help me? Finish what you started first, #.
Don't forget those vows you've already made, my friend.
You should remember those you have already pledged to help.
