We Men of Dale value honour and loyalty, #, and you should too. Go and make good on your promises.
I can't burden you with more work, #. You have unfinished business with others.
Don't you have unfinished business?
I thought you'd already made pledges to others, #? You should hold to those first.
An honourable Barding doesn't forget his pledges, #.
Don't come looking for more work when you're already busy.
Go and finish what you started, #.
I can't ask more of you when you've made promises to others.
Make good on your pledges before you offer to help others, #. It wouldn't be right.
It wouldn't be right of me to accept your help. Fulfil your other promises first, #!
Haven't you already promised to help someone else?
We do not take vows of service lightly, #.
