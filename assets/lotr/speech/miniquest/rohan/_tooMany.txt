I'm not going to load a horse if it already has trouble standing on its legs, #.
I am grateful that you would help me, but I simply can't ask any more of you, #.
You should help those who already asked you for a favour, #.
If a farmer worked twice the land he could farm, he'd get half a harvest.
Aren't you already busy, #?
Too heavy a load will break a horse's back. Finish what duties you've already taken on, #.
It is noble of you to offer your help, but you should see to your unfinished business first.
I cannot ask more of you while you've so much still to do.
Go and see to the duties that were asked of you, #.
We Men of Rohan honour our promises to help others. You should do so too, #.
You have too many unfulfilled tasks to be of use to me.
You're a busy fellow, #. Now, go and finish what was asked of you.
