Ah, the mighty Kine of Araw, #! Have you seen them? They are the mounts of gods and kings, out of legends of old... and their horns will fetch a pretty price. I know a Dwarf who would pay dearly for the horn of such a beast. If you would happen to have one lying around, my friend... I would make sure you profit from it.
