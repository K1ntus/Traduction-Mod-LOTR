I appreciate a brave adventurer like yourself trying to help me, but you have already too many duties weighing on your mind.
I appreciate your offer, but you are too busy, #.
You already have too many tasks to do, #. Complete some of them and please, come back - I will reward you generously.
Your concern does you credit, but I won't burden you with my troubles until you free yourself from yours.
You are eager to help me, my friend, and I thank you, but you are much too busy.
I wish I was still a strong young lad like you, but I can't accept your help until you help those who you already promised.
I could not possibly burden you with more tasks, my friend.
You seem very busy, my friend. Please, come back when you have less work to do.
Thank you for the offer of help, my friend, but you are far too busy.
You should help those who you have already made promises to.
Haven't you already promised to help others, #?
You are quite busy enough as it is, #.
