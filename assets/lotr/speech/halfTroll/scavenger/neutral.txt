What do you want, you rat?
If you want to trade with me, you'll need some of those shiny coins.
I don't trade with any rat that comes by.
Coins, coins and even more coins - that is what I want.
You'll need to prove yourself, if you want to get a look at my treasures.
Hah! Do you really think I'd trade with a little rat like you?
You'll need to swing your blade many more times before you can trade with me!
I don't trust you, maggot. I won't trade with you. Go and kill some of those stinky Men and then we can talk.
Go slay some of those filthy Men if you want to trade with me!
What do you think you're doing, maggot?
You want some goods? Prove your allegiance to the Eye first.
I do not trade with maggots.
You are new in our lands, so I will say no for now.
Coins and cut heads - do you have them?
I will not trade with a filthy little maggot like you!
If you wish to buy some of my high-quality goods, you'll need to do more for us.
Do not show your ugly face again unless you have cut some Man-heads.
You have better done some head-cutting or you won't be getting any of my goods!
Get back when you've killed some of those filthy Men.
What do you want from me, maggot?
You won't be getting anything from me!
I do not trade with filthy Men!
You won't be getting anything from me until you kill some of those filthy Men!
Prove yourself to the Eye and then I might consider trading with you.
