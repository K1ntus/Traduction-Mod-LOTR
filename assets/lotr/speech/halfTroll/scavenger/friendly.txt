Ah! If it isn't my favourite maggot - I mean customer!
I've got all you need!
Blades, bows, draughts, Man-flesh, tools - I've got it all.
You want it - I'll sell you it!
For just a few coins, you can buy some of my high-quality goods!
What do you want, #?
My boys tell me that you're good. You may trade with me.
These are hard times, #. Goods are scarce. The Great Eye is sending us to battle those filthy Men of the North.
War is upon us? Do you know what that means? More head-cutting and more business!
I have the best trades in all of Harad!
If you have the coins, I have the goods!
I do not like to trade with filthy Men, but you, #, are an exception!
You need a head-cutter? I got one for you!
I'll sell you the best tools and weapons in the South!
I sell, you buy - it's that simple!
Do you have some coins, #? If not, we can't make a deal.
I hear the Eye praises you. You may trade with me.
I don't usually trade with Man-maggots, but you have proven you are worthy enough.
There is no trader North, South, West or East that can offer you a better deal than I can.
Ah, #! What goods do you wish to buy from the mighty Half-trolls of Harad?
What can I get you, little Man?
I have the finest equipment in all of the Sunlands!
I can get you anything, #!
Give me some silver coins and I'll give you some goods!
