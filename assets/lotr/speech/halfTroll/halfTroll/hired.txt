We shall serve you, #!
No puny Man-blade may stop us!
We will proudly fight for you! The world of Men shall burn!
No mere Man may stand in our way.
My heart desires battle and my stomach Man-flesh! Ha! Ha!
We shall plunder the rich lands of the north! Will you lead us, #?
I heard there's some good treasure in the north.
Man-flesh! I can already smell it.
We shall proudly fight alongside a great warrior such as you!
My boys shall follow you!
Death to the filthy Men of the North! Their lands shall soon be ours.
We shall burn the World of Men!
Come, #! The Lidless Eye commands us to go North.
Can you get us some Man-flesh?
The Eye is ever watching, #. We must obey it.
Soon we must depart to the North. War is calling.
War! Man-flesh! Treasure! We want it all!
Our armies shall crush the puny Men of the North!
We will fight for you, #! We will follow you to war!
The Great Eye is readying for war. Soon it shall unleash its might upon those pitiful Men in the North. Soon!
No-one shall stand in our way!
The Man-scum shall tremble before us!
We serve the Great Lord of Mordor!
Let us squish those filthy Men!
Can you smell the fear in those puny Men? I can!
