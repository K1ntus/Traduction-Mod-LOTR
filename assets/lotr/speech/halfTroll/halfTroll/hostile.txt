What are you doing here, you filthy little Man?
I shall cook you on a stick, you filthy worm!
Run back to your pitiful tribe, filth!
You'll be lion meal once I'm done with you!
I shall squish you like an insect!
Fool of a Man! Did you travel all this way to become dinner! Ha! Ha!
Where do you think you're going, filthy Man?
Come back here! I'll make Man-flesh stew out of you!
I shall enjoy tearing you up, you puny worm!
Come here, boys! I've found our dinner! Ha! Ha!
I will throw you to the lions, you little treacherous worm!
Run, maggot, or become croc-food!
This is our land, filthy Man, and you shall not escape us!
There's nowhere to run, little Man!
Well, what do we have here? Oh yes! Dinner!
Filthy worm, how dare you enter our lands?
You're next in the cauldron!
How did the lions not make supper out of you? No matter. I shall do so instead!
I'll make a good roast out of you!
You shall burn in the light of the Lidless Eye!
I will squish you like an insect, scum!
I'll make quick work out of you, filth!
You won't see the next day, Man-scum!
I will feed your flesh to my lions!
Your puny weapon is no match for me!
