Welcome to our land, little maggot!
We Half-trolls are far better warriors than those puny little tribesmen.
Raaarrrgh!
The Great Eye is ever watching.
The Great Fire-Eye is calling us. We must obey.
Do you bring us messages from Him, #?
We shall crush the pitiful Men of the North!
The Great Eye has promised us great hoards of treasure and flesh for our service in war. Will you join us?
Soon we shall rule these lands from West to East, and no filthy Men will be able to oppose us! Ha! Ha!
Flesh! My Trolls want flesh!
I hear that the Lidless Eye speaks highly of you. You may stay in our lands.
You may be a filthy little Man, #, but the Eye seems to like you.
I hate those filthy little Men, but the Great Eye commands us to fight with them, and we must obey.
I heard that there are great treasures in the North, and plenty of Man-flesh.
Prepare your weapons, #! My folk shall go to war in the North soon!
Do you have some Man-flesh for me?
We are mighty warriors! No puny Man may stand in our way!
You seem to be useful, so we won't eat you... for now! Ha! Ha!
Man-flesh we want, and Man-flesh we shall have!
The Dark Lord is calling us. We shall soon head into the North.
We serve the Lord of Mordor!
No mere Man may stand in our way!
Welcome, stranger. What do you want?
Soon, very soon, we shall have dominion over all these lands. The great Eye has promised it!
