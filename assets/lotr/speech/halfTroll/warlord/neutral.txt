You think you may command the might of Harad? Ha!
What do you want, maggot? Kill some stinking Men and then come back!
We do not let any mere maggot command our mighty warriors.
I would not let a little worm like you command my boys.
You want to command my lads? Get some Man-blood on your name and then we can talk.
If you kill some of those filthy little North-men, I might let you command my boys.
The Eye won't let any little worm command its armies.
A little maggot like you cannot command my troops.
The might of Harad shall reach to all the corners of this world. Do you have what it takes to command us? I think not.
What do you want, you maggot? You want some troops? Ha! Get back when you kill some of those filthy Men.
The armies of Harad shall be unleashed on the puny Men of the North. Their world shall burn. Will you join them or us?
Ha! I am not going to let any mere Man command my mighty warriors!
We Half-trolls do not follow any mere Man into battle. Prove yourself!
Go cut some heads and then come back if you wish to get my troops.
What do you want? Some troops? Ha! Come back when you've actually done some killing.
No mere Man may command the armies of Harad.
You want some blade-swingers, eh? Go kill some of those stinking Men and then show your little maggot face again.
You think you may command the armies of the Half-trolls? Ha! Ha! You may want to think again.
Kill some of those puny Men and then I may let you command my troops.
The Great One is calling us. We shall go to war very soon. If you wish you to command us, prove yourself to the Eye.
You are not yet worthy enough to command my mighty warriors.
Go slay those filthy Men and then I'll give you some warriors.
My mighty warriors don't follow any stranger to battle!
Prove yourself to the Eye if you wish to command my warriors!
You won't be getting any warriors from me, maggot!
