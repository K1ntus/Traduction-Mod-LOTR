Get some more deeds to your name, #, and I might let you command my warriors!
I almost mistook you for one of those filthy Strawheads.
You'll have to earn some respect among our people if you want to lead us into battle.
And what do you want?
You are yet young among our people, #. Great Men do not follow lesser Men.
You want to hire some Dunlendings? Prove your worth first, #! 
We would not let a simple and strange Man, such as yourself, command our mighty troops!
The great warriors of Dunland will not follow a stranger into battle.
We do not simply follow any mere Man to war. 
You want to command my troops? You need to prove yourself to our people first!
Only great heroes of our people are worthy of leading us into battle!
