I have many strong warriors ready for hire, #!
The service of my warriors can be yours for just a few silver coins.
Looking to hire an army, #?
Few can stand before the might of a mob of Dunlendings!
We Men of Dunland are proud and loyal warriors.
My Men will follow you into battle without fear.
Have any silver coins, #?
Death to the Strawheads!
You wish to bring death to the Strawheads? My Men shall fight for you!
All will flee from the might of Dunland!
Those filthy Rohirrim shall feel the edge of our swords!
Give me just a few silver coins, and I will give you my mighty warriors.
We Men of Dunland are strong and great warriors! We shall cleanse the lands of the filthy dogs of Rohan!
