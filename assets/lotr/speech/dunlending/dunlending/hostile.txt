Your doom comes swiftly, #!
Your kind is not welcome here.
Curse you, #!
Stop, #. You are unwelcome here!
Flee, wretched friend of the horse-lords!
Raaaargh!
Death to the Strawheads and their kin!
Down you go, #!
What devilry of Rohan comes hence?
Your end shall be swift, strawhead-scum!
Run, scum, run back to those pitiful horse-riding cowards!
Death to you and all your kin!
Be gone, scum of Rohan!
You shall pay for your crimes, #!
Death to the robbers of the North!
This is your last stand, Strawhead scum!
Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads!
