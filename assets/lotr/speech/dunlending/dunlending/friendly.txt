Any enemy of Rohan is a friend of Dunland!
We have sworn vengeance on the people of Rohan. Will you fight with us, #?
Our lands were taken by the Strawheads of Rohan.
We Dunlendings are a proud and vicious race.
Death to the Men of Rohan!
Our feud with the thieving Rohirrim is centuries old.
Do you fight with us, #?
The land of Rohan should by rights be ours. Those filthy, strawheaded Men of the River have no claim to it!
If the horse-lords are your enemy, #, then we welcome you into our land.
What do you want?
Those filthy Strawheads shall pay for stealing our lands from us!
The land shall be stained with the blood of Rohan!
Stranger, what do you want in our lands?
Shall you help us reclaim what is rightfully ours?
A day shall come when the pitiful Men of Rohan will pay for what they have done!
Death! Death to the robbers of the North!
The Strawheads came down from the North, and took our fathers' lands! They will pay in blood, #.
