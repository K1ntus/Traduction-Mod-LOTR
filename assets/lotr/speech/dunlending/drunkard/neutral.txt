You looking for a fight?
Oh ho! To the bottle I go!
You're a beautiful girl, #.
Raaargh!
What did you just say about me?
Tonight, #, we shall feast like kings!
Hands off my drink!
Splish splash splosh! Splish splash plump!
To and fro! To and fro! Up we come! Down we go!
Good day, #! Or is it morning! No it's night! Ha! Ha!
Hey ho! To the bottle I go!
Ale! Ale! Sweet ale! Oh yes! Yes!
Death to Dunland... I mean Rohan!
The bottle is my saviour! To the bottle I must go!
This mug shall be the bane of all Rohirrim!
