By the star of Eärendil, I swear I shall see you slain!
You are not welcome in Lindon!
You are not welcome in Lindon, #!
You may not set foot in this fair realm!
Flee these lands, #!
For Lindon!
Perish, you Morgul-demon!
No longer shall you darken these lands, #!
I swear by the Valar, I shall put an end to your evil!
To Udûn with you!
Go and kiss an Orc!
Death to the foes of the Elves!
Who brings to us this token of doom?
Begone, foul servant of the Enemy!
Leave this land, or face the edge of our blades!
I will not allow evil to taint the land of Lindon. You shall soon meet your doom, #.
By the Valar! How dare you enter this land, #?
Flee, scum of Mordor, or face the a rain of arrows.
How dare you poison this fair realm with your foul feet?
