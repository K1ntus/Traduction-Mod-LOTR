Greetings, #. What can I forge for you?
The smith-skill of my kin is amongst the greatest in these lands!
I have many mighty weapons that I can offer you!
No Orc-arrow may pierce the armour that I forge!
What do you need, mellon-nin?
No spawn of evil may stand against our bows and blades!
What can I get you, #? 
These are dark times, #. The Evil has returned. We must defend our borders. It is my duty to provide my friends with weapons.
No Orc-blade can match the sharpness and might of my blades!
These times are dangerous. Many Orcs have been sighted near our lands... they must be driven away or else the Shadow shall win.
The foes of our kin shall tremble beneath the mighty blades that I forge!
Since the darkening of Ered Luin, we have not received much new metal. We always require more.
The Evil has returned to Angmar. My kin shall soon go to battle. I must prepare the weapons and armour.
I am always in need of more metals for my smith-work. I will reward you if you bring me some.
I have learnt much of the skills of forging and smithing in my thousands of years of walking in this world.
