Only the strongest friends of the Dúnedain may fight with us in battle, #.
If you wish to captain the Rangers of the North, you must prove your trust.
Are you friend or foe, #?
They say you are a friend of the Dúnedain, but I cannot be sure until you have done more good.
One does not simply command Rangers of the North without gaining some reputation first.
You are not yet thought of highly enough to fight with my Rangers in battle, #.
Show us that you can be trusted, #, and we will fight alongside you.
You will have to prove yourself to our kin, if you wish to command some of our mighty Rangers.
We Rangers do not follow any stranger into battle. You will have to prove that you truly fight for good in this world.
Prove your allegiance to us, and we shall ally with you.
You must prove yourself worthy first, if you wish to lead us to battle.
Only a true friend of our folk may lead us against the servants of evil.
