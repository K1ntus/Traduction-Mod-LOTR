Your death shall come swift as the arrow that pierces flesh, #!
I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in these lands, #!
Flee our lands, you wretched ally of the Morgul-filth!
You are an enemy of the race of Men, #!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back into the night, #!
You thought you could match our skill? You are sorely mistaken!
When did # forsake reason for madness?
Your doom approaches, #!
Do not underestimate the Rangers of the North.
Go back to the darkness whence you came!
What devilry of the Dark Lord do you bring here?
Begone from these lands!
You shall meet your doom swiftly, scum of Mordor!
I will not allow you to harm the free folk of these lands!
