Long have we guarded these lands, #.
We Rangers have watched over these lands for generations lost to memory.
What brings you to this wilderness, #?
May your journey be swift and your cloak warm, #.
By nightfall this land will be crawling with Orcs.
Be on your guard, #. There are many enemies in these parts.
Good day, #. From which land do you hail?
Keep a safe camp at night, and stay out of the shadows.
It is not for nothing that we watch these lands, #. Many foul beasts nest here.
We Rangers remember the ancient lore of the West. We have ways to walk unseen.
These lands are my domain, #, and I do all in my power to safeguard them.
Beware the wretched Morgul-scum that crawls out at night, #.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the Orc that one fears.
Were it not for us, these lands would have fallen to the darkness long ago.
Many of the folk that dwell here consider us bandits and outcasts. They do not know our true duties.
My kin has long guarded these lands from the dangers that lie to the North.
Be wary, #. Many new dangers have arisen in these dark days.
As long as we watch over these lands, travellers such as you will be able to journey in peace, #.
Lonely folk are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters - but hunters ever of the servants of the Enemy.
The servants of the Enemy are found in many places, not in Mordor only.
Beware of the ancient wights and shades that roam this land, #. It is said they can take over your body.
In time of need, we will ride to the aid of Isildur's heir.
Our homes, such as we have, are here in the North.
