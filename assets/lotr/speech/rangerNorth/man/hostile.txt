I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in these lands, #!
Flee our lands, you wretched ally of the Morgul-filth!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back into the night, #!
Begone, Orc-scum!
Do not underestimate the Rangers of the North.
Go back to the darkness whence you came!
What devilry of the Dark Lord do you bring here?
Begone from these lands!
You ruffian!
I will not do dealings with criminals.
Leave now, or be forced out!
Come back, servant of the night! I have a bright blade for you!
How did you find your way into our lands?
These lands are guarded closely, #. You will find no refuge here!
There is no refuge here for the likes of you!
Villains like you are unwelcome here!
These lands are secret, #, and so they shall remain!
What are you, #? Some Orc-spy?
If the Enemy sent you here, he will hear nothing back from you!
