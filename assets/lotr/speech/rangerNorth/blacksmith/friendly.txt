Want some equipment? Just bring me a few silver coins.
Welcome, #! What can I forge for you?
I never have enough materials to make the arms we need.
I see you are a friend of the North, #.
Might you be seeking some fine arms, #?
Might you be needing some new armour? It's dangerous out in the wild.
I'm still looking for an apprentice...
I forge the best weaponry in all the North!
Would that we still remembered the craft of our forefathers, #. I would make you fine armour, and blades.
In Arnor of old, the smiths made beautiful helms and gilded chestplates. I prefer something a little more functional.
Good day, #! Do you require some fine equipment?
Welcome to the North, #! What can I get you?
These are dark days... materials are scarce and expensive.
What do you need, #?
What brings you to this wilderness, #?
Be on your guard, #. There are many enemies in these parts.
The old that is strong does not wither. Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes, a fire shall be woken.
Renewed shall be blade that was broken. The crownless again shall be king!
The old craft of Arnor is lost to time, but I can still forge a good helmet.
There are none today who can work metal like the smiths of old. Not even myself.
I cannot forge armour in the likeness of the old kingdom, but I can make a suit to keep you safe, #.
The realm of Arnor is lost, and with it, the smith-craft of Westernesse too.
