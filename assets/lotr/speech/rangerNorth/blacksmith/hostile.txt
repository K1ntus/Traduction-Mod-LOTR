I shan't be forging anything for you!
You are an enemy of the North!
You are an enemy of the Free Peoples, #!
What are the likes of you doing in the North?
Get out of my sight, you cur!
I refuse to trade with scoundrels like you, #.
I do not forge for the servants of evil! Begone!
You will not get anything from me, #!
Scum of Angmar! How dare you enter these lands?
The Rangers of the North shall make quick work out of you!
I will give you nothing, #!
Get away from here!
Crawl back into the abyss!
Flee, back to your dark masters, #!
I'll beat you with this until the Rangers come!
This hammer is good for more than forging steel!
