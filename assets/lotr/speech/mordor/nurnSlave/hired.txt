What does my master command?
What would you have me farm, my lord?
Must get back to work.
I fear the lash...
I am working as hard as I can, my lord.
What is my next task, my lord #?
All these crops, and not a scrap for us to eat...
What do you require of me, master?
I will do as you command.
Can I have some bread, master?
I'm working as hard as I can! Please, no more lashes!
What do you want me to do, my lord #?
