You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of Men can command Orcs, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any Orcs to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
The Orcs of Mordor would never follow a weakling like you, #!
You think Lugb√∫rz just hands out Orcs to any old maggot?
You will need to prove yourself to the Eye, if you wish to command his mighty orcs.
I don't just let any old maggot hire my Orcs! Come back when you have some Man-blood on your hands!
Go kill some of those filthy Gondorians and then I might let you hire some of my fine Orcs.
My Orcs only follow true servants of the Eye.
Prove yourself to the Eye and I will let you command my Orcs!
