If I had all the wine in the world, I would not share a single drop with you.
You are an enemy of Dorwinion!
Go away before I call for the Vintner Guard.
Get out of our lands!
You are a villain, #.
I shall have no dealings with you.
Begone, #!
The Elves would not tolerate your presence here, and neither shall I!
Do not speak to me, you baseborn rat!
