Good day, #. Have you come to hire a vinehand?
Have you come to purchase some grapes, #?
I would advise against trying to steal from this vineyard.
Greetings, #.
I oversee the production of grapes here.
Would you like to work in the vineyard?
Have you come to trade, or to work, #?
My vinehands are hard-working and very efficient.
Ah, the grapes of Dorwinion! I could spend a lifetime in this vineyard, #.
These vineyards truly are beautiful.
