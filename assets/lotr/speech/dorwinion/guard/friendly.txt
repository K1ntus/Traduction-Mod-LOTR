We defend the land of Dorwinion.
This is mostly a peaceful land, #. But you never know what might happen.
The Easterlings are no threat to us. They want our wine, not our blood.
If you see any troublemakers, let me know.
We don't take kindly to theft around here.
You should think twice before trying to steal from any vineyards around here.
The mighty Vintner Guard of old, reduced to fighting petty criminals! It is a shame indeed.
You look like a good law-abiding citizen, #. I hope that is the case.
Any whispers of an Easterling invasion are nonsense. They are our friends in trade, you see, not our enemies.
You'll be fine as long as you don't cause any trouble.
Hello there, #! What have you been up to today?
Move along now.
Welcome to Dorwinion, the civilised heart of Middle-earth! Just don't go any further east.
I don't take kindly to troublemakers.
I defend the wines of Dorwinion. And its people too!
I have heard tales of the golden guards of Rh√∫del, all bedecked in gems and gilded steel. It sounds like pompous foolery to me.
