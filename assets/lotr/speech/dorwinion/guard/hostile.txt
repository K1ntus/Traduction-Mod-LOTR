There's no room for villains like you in Dorwinion!
Get out of Dorwinion before we drive you out with our pikes!
You are no friend of Dorwinion, #.
You should not have come here.
You will go no further, #!
You must leave Dorwinion now!
Get away, #! No wine for you!
You have the manner of a common rogue, and I shall deal with you like one!
Run along now, scoundrel!
I will spill your blood like bitter wine!
You would do well to fear us, #!
Don't tempt me, scum!
