Don't do that again, #.
I'll let you off... this time.
We don't take kindly to thieves here. This is your warning.
If you leave now, I'll pretend I never saw that.
Don't try that again.
Those grapes aren't yours, are they?
Those aren't yours to pick, my friend.
Think very carefully before trying that again.
