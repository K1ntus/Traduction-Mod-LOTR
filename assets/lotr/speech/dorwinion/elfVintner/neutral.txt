There is no wine for you, unfortunately, #.
The Elven-wine of Dorwinion is not for those of weak spirit.
I am afraid I have no more wine to spare.
You should not be looking to drink Elven-wine, #.
I would not be willing to trade with lowborn Men like you.
What are you doing in here, #?
The wine of Dorwinion is not just given out to anyone, #.
