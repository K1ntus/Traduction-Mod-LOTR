Ah, #! Have you come to buy some wine?
The Elven-wine of Dorwinion is sweeter than any other.
I must soon send these barrels off to the Woodland Realm.
We Elves brew the best wine in Dorwinion.
Have you come to buy wine from me, #? A good decision indeed!
Which sort do you prefer, #? Red or white? Or perhaps some grape juice?
I brew so much wine that I've taken to drinking the excess myself.
We vintner-elves are renowned for our brewing. Go on, #, try some.
