You are accursed, #!
It was unwise of you to venture here.
You are an enemy of Dorwinion.
You are no friend of Dorwinion!
A thousand lives of Men would pass before I would do trade with you!
You are not worthy of the lowest Mannish grape juice!
What are you, #? A common thief? An Orcish spy? Begone!
You will regret coming here!
I will put an end to your villainy!
Begone, scum!
