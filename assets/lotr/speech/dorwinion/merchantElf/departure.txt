Come quickly, #! I must be moving along soon.
Hurry, #, or you will miss out on the sweetest wine you ever tasted!
The trade-goods of Dorwinion cannot linger here forever.
We must be moving on soon.
This is your last chance to taste some fine wine!
The wine of Dorwinion is almost spent! Come quickly, #.
My time here is ending. Soon I must move on to other lands.
We must return to Dorwinion soon. If you wish to trade, come at once!
Do you wish to trade, #? The hour draws late, and it is almost time to journey on.
I must soon be on my way.
We cannot stay here forever, #. If you seek the fruits of Dorwinion, come at once.
I will soon be leaving to seek my kin in the Woodland Realm.
I cannot tarry here forever, #. My friends in the Woodland Realm await me.
