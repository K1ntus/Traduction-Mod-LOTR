The guards of Dorwinion do not serve just anyone, #.
These guards are hired by vintner-elves and noblemen. They do not serve lowborn peasants like you!
You may be our friend, #, but you are no nobleman.
What are you doing here? Go back to picking grapes.
You are not worthy of the Vintner Guard.
These men are well-trained, loyal, and strong. They serve only the highborn of Dorwinion. Not fools like you.
What do you think we are, #, a band of mercenaries? Away with you.
