Welcome, #. Have you come to hire my guards?
The Vintner Guard make excellent personal guards too, #.
My guards are not cheap, #, but they are loyal.
Ah, #! I have heard tales of your deeds. You seem like an honest friend of Dorwinion.
Elves may be powerful, #, but they are fickle too. You have made the right choice to come to me.
For just a small sum of money, these guards might be yours.
I can't wait to get home and drink some wine.
My guards are well-trained, #.
