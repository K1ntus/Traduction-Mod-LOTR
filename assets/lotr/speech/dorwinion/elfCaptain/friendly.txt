You are noble indeed, #. The Order of Bladorthin would be willing to serve you.
You have earned my respect, #. What do you want?
The Order of Bladorthin do not bow and scrape to weak Men. But you are no weak Man, #.
My warriors are the finest Elves in all Middle-earth.
I will grant you command of my warriors, #. For a price, of course.
You have the grace of an Elf-friend. What is it you need, #?
