I and my kin defend this land from enemies both near and far.
Welcome to Dorwinion, #.
We are an old and powerful order.
The spears of Bladorthin were delivered at last! And now Dorwinion has grown stronger than ever.
I defend Dorwinion and its people.
Our spears are of Dwarvish make. Have you heard the old tale, #?
While we stand, no Orc or foul beast shall enter Dorwinion.
