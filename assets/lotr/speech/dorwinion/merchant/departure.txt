Come quickly, #! I must be moving along soon.
Hurry, #, or you will miss out on the sweetest wine you ever tasted!
The trade-goods of Dorwinion cannot linger here forever.
We must be moving on soon.
This is your last chance to taste some fine wine!
The wine of Dorwinion is almost spent! Come quickly, #.
My time here is ending. Soon I must move on to trade in other lands.
We must return to Dorwinion soon. If you wish to trade, come at once!
I must soon be on my way.
We cannot stay here forever, #. If you seek the fruits of Dorwinion, come at once.
