I do not sell my products to any stranger who passes by!
Your money alone can't pay for my products.
Who are you even?
Come back when you're not nothing.
You are not worthy of wearing my armour!
Prove yourself here and then I may sell you something!
I will not give out my mighty swords to just anyone!
Get a meaning to that name of yours and I might sell you some of my fine weaponry, #.
You must prove yourself in these lands first, #.
It takes more than coins to buy one of my blades, #.
