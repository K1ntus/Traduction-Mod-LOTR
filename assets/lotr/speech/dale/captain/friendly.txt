I offer the mighty men of Dale for hire!
You will find the mightiest soldiers of Dale here!
For only a small sum of money, you may command several powerful soldiers.
Greetings, #! Are you here to hire some of my men?
None can match the skill of my soldiers.
Money wins wars, not men! Ha ha!
I will offer you command of my men, if you can pay for them.
The men of Dale are the mightiest warriors in these lands.
Nothing shall stand in the way of my men!
Do you wish to hire my men, #?
