You are not yet worthy of commanding my men.
Come back when you have proven yourself!
Do you think I'd let someone like you command my men? Hah! No.
Your money alone is not enough to command my men.
You must prove yourself as a worthy battle-commander first, #!
Come back when you have some honour to your name!
I do not give out my men for hire to any stranger that passes by!
You wish to hire troops? Prove yourself to the Kingdom of Dale, and then we can talk!
Go kill some outlaws and Orcs, and then come back!
I don't allow any stranger to command my men.
