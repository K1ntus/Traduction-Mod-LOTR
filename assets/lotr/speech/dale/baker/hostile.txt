Get out!
Get out! Out, I said!
We don't tolerate scoundrels like you in Dale!
Be on your way, #!
I won't be selling anything to you.
Be on your way or I'll beat you with this loaf!
We don't appreciate your kind here!
I don't deal with villains, #!
You should be locked up, not wandering around cake shops!
I don't care how much money you have, #, you're not buying anything here!
Oh I've heard all about you, #. You won't be getting any pastries from me!
Get out of my shop!
Off with you, or I'll summon the guards!
I don't want you causing trouble in my shop!
The soldiers will be after you, #!
We don't want any of your kind here, thank you very much!
Oh no, you won't be buying any cakes from me!
Get out of my bakery, you scum!
No cram for you, #!
Run off! Else I'll beat you with this!
