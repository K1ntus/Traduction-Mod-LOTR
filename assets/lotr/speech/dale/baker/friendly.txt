Welcome, #! What can I get for you today?
If you want delicious food, you've come to the right place!
Dalish pastries are the finest in all of Middle-earth!
Have a look around, #. See anything you like?
It may not be cheap, but it's certainly tasty!
Welcome to @, home of the tastiest cakes in the whole wide world!
You do look hungry, #.
Got a family to feed? I'm sure they'll love something from @!
Well, #, you look just like someone who'd enjoy one of my freshly baked pies!
Dear oh dear, you do look hungry!
Everything is freshly baked and made with only the finest Dalish and Dorwinian ingredients!
Are you hungry, #?
So, #, which cake will it be for you?
What's that? Yes, of course I put new cakes out on display every day, #.
Don't think you can get away with eating any of the displays!
Don't go to that other bakery down the road, #. I've heard bad things about their cakes. They'll rot your teeth, they will.
Who would waste their money on a blacksmith when you can come here instead?
Buy something!
Come back any time you like. I'm here all day, every day.
I'm starting to get tired of holding this loaf.
No, the stuff in the barrel isn't for sale.
What? No, of course I'm not going to tell you how to make a Dalish pastry!
Cram! Tasty, filling, and refreshing. Great for long journeys. Much better than that Elvish rubbish.
Going on an adventure? Then you'll want to take some cram with you, my friend!
Not another bleeding Dwarf! We've had quite enough - oh, it's you, #. Please forgive me.
I'm sure your children would love to come here!
Please don't walk on the displays.
Go on, buy a cake. Who knows, perhaps it might even take your mind off the decline of the West for a while.
