I guard the lands of Dale.
Nothing shall threaten the Kingdom of Dale under my watch.
Our enemies fear our spears and swords.
The Kingdom of Dale has grown mighty since the days of Smaug's demise.
I will not allow any Orc or bandit to enter this land!
The days are growing dark, #. I fear soon we shall be at war.
I gladly protect these lands.
The Kingdom of Dale has grown great, thanks to the courage of brave soldiers. Yes! Just like myself!
Welcome to the land of Dale, #!
We must remain vigilant.
I hear worrisome reports of skirmishes on our eastern borders.
Rumours say that Men of the East have been crossing over the Redwater. I must hope they are but rumours.
We cannot hold off the barbarians in the East forever, #. If they should mount an attack... I fear for us all.
