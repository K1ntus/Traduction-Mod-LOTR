I will make quick work of you, scum!
Be gone from these lands, foul Orc-servant!
You shall meet my sword!
You shall be punished for your crimes!
I will not allow you to go further!
Die, bandit-wretch!
You stand no chance against our spears and blades, scoundrel!
You will pass no further, villain!
Your days of crime have come to an end, #!
By my sword, you wil fall!
